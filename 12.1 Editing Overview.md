# 12.1 Editing Overview

### 12.1.1

It is recommended that Editors use a "bottom up" mentality for editing (i.e. start with everything at the bottom such as imagery and taxiways and work your way up to 3D objects). A summary of the steps that **should**{.red} be followed is below (although these can be completed in any order that the Editor wishes):

Step 1

[]()

: Look at the available imagery quality (within SASPlanet) to check if it is okay (zoom level 19 or higher), if it is blurry then it will not be worth starting *(see 4.1.2 above)*

Step 2

: Compile charts and other sources to assist (some areas do not have free or public charts available)

Step 3

[]()

: Adjust airport properties *(see 3.2 above)*

Step 4

: Check that the runway is in the correct location using the coordinates, you can then use this as a reference point for the satellite imagery

> Most of the time the runway is already in the correct position

Step 5

[]()

[]()

: Export satellite imagery from SASPlanet and then import into Infinite Flight *(see 4.2.1 and 4.3.1 above)*

Step 6

[]()

: Ensure airport boundary is accurate, and adjust if required *(see 3.3.1 above)*

Step 7

[]()

[]()

: Add and adjust pavements, taxiways and lines *(see 5.1 and 6.1 above)*

Step 8

[]()

[]()

: Add lights, taxiway names, taxiway network and any other properties required *(see 6.2 and 6.3 above)*

Step 9

[]()

: Add spawns/start locations *(see 7.1 above)*

Step 10

[]()

[]()

: Add and edit buildings *(see 8.1 above)*. You can "Download OSM" if you prefer to use this as a starting point *(see 8.1.6 above)*

Step 11

[]()

[]()

: Add objects *(see 9.2 above)*, including jet bridges and stand guidance if applicable *(see 10.2 above)*

Step 12

[]()

[]()

: Adjust jet bridge properties *(see 10.3 above)* and enable jet bridge animations *(see 10.4 above)* if applicable
