If you are flying the majority of short-haul routes you will be using this iconic aircraft this aircraft is recognizable everywhere! It is used in America all the way to the middle of Africa. Why? It is a versatile and great performer in its class. Simple

> **Here are the specifications of the Boeing 737-800**

- **Aircraft Range:** 5,665 kilometres or 3,060 nautical miles
- **Fuel Capacity** 20,896 kg or 8:24 hours of flight time
- **Max Thrust Produced 100% power** 29,000 pounds of thrust
- **Operating Ceiling** 41,000 feet or 12.5 kilometres
- **Cruising Speed** Mach 0.78 or 590 mph
- **Max Takeoff Weight** 79,002 kg
- **Max Landing Weight** 66,349 kg
- **Max Seating Capacity** 189 in a 1 class configuration

> **Taxi Performance**

The Boeing 737-800 is a great taxi it does not randomly speed up and is a great and responsive plane.

To start of no more than 30% N1 should be used to get moving.

Typical taxi speed is around 15-20-25 Ground speed, not Airspeed!

Make sure you taxi at a reasonable speed and not at 34 GS otherwise if you want to turn you won't have time to slow down and pull a tight turn.

That leads us into the next part turns. For a turn of 90 degrees no more than 10 knots GS must be used to turn otherwise the 1 wing will dip into the ground.

If you are using a high-speed exit at a runway you may go quicker but slow down once you reach a 90-degree turn or if you near any terminals or other players.

As you can see these are the same as the -700 variant as there is not much difference.

> **Takeoff performance**

**NOTE:** These metrics were taken on Solo mode with the following.

No winds 0 knots

Maximum Visibility

**10% Load Factor:** 5' Flaps, 5% Trim and 70% Power - **Rotation Speed:** 120 Knots

**20% Load Factor:** 5 Flaps, 7% Trim and 75% Power - **Rotation Speed:** 125 Knots

**30% Load Factor:** 5' Flaps, 7% Trim and 80% Power - **Rotation Speed:** 130 Knots

**40% Load Factor:** 10' Flaps, 7% Trim and 80% Power - **Rotation Speed:** 135 Knots

**50% Load Factor:** 15' Flaps, 7% Trim and 85% Power - **Rotation Speed:** 140 Knots

**60% Load Factor:** 15' Flaps, 7% Trim and 85% Power - **Rotation Speed:** 150 Knots

**70% Load Factor:** 15' Flaps, 7% Trim and 85% Power -  **Rotation Speed:** 160 Knots

**80% Load Factor:** 15' Flaps, 7% Trim and 85% Power - **Rotation Speed:** 165 Knots

**90% Load Factor:** 15' Flaps, 7% Trim and 90% Power - **Rotation Speed:** 170 Knots

**100% Load Factor:** 15' Flaps, 7% Trim and 95% Power - **Rotation Speed:** 175 Knots

> **Climb Performance**

Most times you will climb at a normal V/S of 2200 up until 10,000 Feet.

Once at 10,000 Feet reduce that to 1800V/S and increase speed up to 293

Passing through 28,000 feet lower the V/S to 1000V/S until cruising altitude

The speed will now show Mach 0.78 which is perfectly normal as that is the cruising speed of a Boeing 737-800 aircraft

With an aircraft around this weight, it is advisable to climb to an ALT of around 32,000 to 36,000 Feet to ensure a safe flight.

**NOTE:** This is with a capacity of 70% for a capacity of 71% and above here is the following

Climb at 2000 V/S until 10,000 feet once passing through 10,000 feet lower that to 1600V/S

Passing through 10,000 feet speed up to 293 knots

At 28,000 Feet the speed will show Mach 0.78 which is the cruising speed of a 737-800

Passing through 28,000 Feet decrease that again to 800 V/S.

**NOTE:** With an aircraft, this heavy it is recommended to climb to around 30,000 to 32,000 feet to ensure you maintain a safe speed and do not stall out at higher altitudes where the air is thinner.

> **Cruise Performance**

During the cruise the plane will act normally if treated and managed well here is what you should monitor.

Monitor Winds make sure it is not so severe if it is then climb to an altitude higher or lower try around 2,000 feet lower or higher if those don't work then find the appropriate altitude.

Monitor Speed this is also with winds but if the speed is too high you can Overspeed and get a violation which no one wants.

In general make sure the plane is stable, safe and at cruising speed.

> **Approach Performance**

With 20.1 Infinite Flight introduced VNAV a vertical navigation system that handles the descent through a series of waypoints that have altitudes assigned to them.

That saves up this whole section.

**BUT** Ensure you monitor speed! VNAV does not handle speed and if you go too fast you will descend too quick, miss waypoints or even get a violation. So do not leave your device whilst using VNAV to descend.

> **Landing Performance**

You have now reached 3,000 feet and are on finals into an airport how do you know what speeds to land your plane at? Well, here they are!

**10% Load Factor:** 25' Flaps, 5% Trim - Final approach speed 120 knots.

**20% Load Factor:** 25' Flaps, 7% Trim - Final approach speed 125 knots.

**30% Load Factor:** 40' Flaps, 7% Trim - Final approach speed 125 knots.

**40% Load Factor:** 40' Flaps, 7% Trim - Final approach speed 130 knots

**50% Load Factor:** 40' Flaps, 7% Trim - Final approach speed 140 knots

As you can see I am not including 51% and above landing speeds as it is not advisable to land at that weight. Also, it heads into MLW which you want to be at least 20% away from to ensure a stable and safe landing
