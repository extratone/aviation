### Store all available server-side flight history data locally in JSON format.

This one is designed to systematically query the Live API for all available data for each flight in one's flight history (which ultimately results in [an overview](https://infiniteflight.com/guide/developer-reference/live-api/user-flight#get-user-flights), a set of [flight *plan* details](https://infiniteflight.com/guide/developer-reference/live-api/flight-plan), and a set of [flight *route* details](https://infiniteflight.com/guide/developer-reference/live-api/flight-route).)

Out of the box, it uses a (free, frugal, and very useful) app called [Data Jar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/data-jar/id1453273600) to store said data in JSON format.

*Note: At the moment, running this shortcut often is going to result in a lot of redundant queries. I've been doing so once every two weeks.*
