### Description

> PilotBuddy is an essential app for pilots, providing all the information they need to make informed decisions before and during their flights. With PilotBuddy, pilots can easily access important information about airports, including METAR (Meteorological Aerodrome Report), TAF (Terminal Aerodrome Forecast), NOTAMs (Notices to Airmen), PIREPs (Pilot Reports), real-time weather conditions, and webcams.

> One of the key features of PilotBuddy is its comprehensive airport directory, which includes detailed information on thousands of airports around the world. Pilots can search for airports by name, ICAO or IATA code, and view important details such as runway lengths, frequencies, etc.

> In addition to airport information, PilotBuddy also provides access to vital aviation weather data, including METAR and TAF reports, which provide pilots with current and forecasted weather conditions at their destination airport. This includes information on visibility, wind direction and speed, and cloud cover.

> PilotBuddy also includes a NOTAMs feature, allowing pilots to view notices that may affect their flight, such as temporary flight restrictions or runway closures. The app also includes a PIREPs feature, which allows pilots to view reports from other pilots on actual weather conditions and other important information.

> But that's not all - PilotBuddy also includes a webcam feature, providing pilots with live streaming video from airports around the world. This can be especially useful for getting a real-time look at weather conditions and other factors that may impact a flight.

> One unique feature of PilotBuddy is the ability to view METAR, TAF, and NOTAM reports along a flight path. This allows pilots to plan for any potential weather or other issues that may arise during the flight.

> Overall, PilotBuddy is an essential tool for any pilot, providing access to all the information and resources needed to make safe and informed flying decisions.
