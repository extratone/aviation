> Airport editing often requires coordinates which can be provided in a variety of formats. [www.earthpoint.us/convert.aspx](http://www.earthpoint.us/convert.aspx) can be helpful to convert them into the desired format

## Opening the Scenery Editor

### 3.1.2

Step 1

: Open the Infinite Flight App and select "Scenery Editor"

Step 2

: Choose the airport that you wish to edit and then select any runway or parking position. Tap "Ok" and then "Open" to begin

Step 3

: If you are editing a new airport (or working on an existing one which does not have a thread on the IFC yet), a topic will automatically be created in the [Scenery Editor Category](https://community.infiniteflight.com/c/scenery-editing/47). Whenever new versions are uploaded, the changelogs will be added automatically to each thread so it's easy to keep track. All communication about a particular airport **must**{.red} remain within it's specific thread

Step 4

: When you first upload an airport, it will automatically assign you to that airport (this prevents others from uploading to the same airport)
