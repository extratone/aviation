\+++ Do's and Don'ts

| **:fa-check-circle: DO's**                                                                        | **:fa-times-circle: DON'Ts**                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Add roads and taxiways as shown in charts and satellite imagery                                   | Add public roads which are invisible or irrelevant for pilots using the airport     |
| Add grass taxiways where they are used for aircraft movements                                     | Add grass taxiways to replicate pieces of lawn which are not used as movement areas |
| Add public roads in areas which are prominently visible from aircraft movement areas              | Add concrete or snow pavements to replicate bright asphalt areas                    |
| Add concrete pavement below hangar buildings (other materials are allowed if this is present IRL) | Create pavement areas using lots of small segments unnecessarily                    |
| Use as few pieces of pavement as possible (the hole cutting tool helps with this)                 | Add snow pavements to create texts or symbols on the ground                         |
|                                                                                                   | Add any types of “easter eggs”                                                      |

## Editing an Existing Pavements Shape

### 5.1.2
