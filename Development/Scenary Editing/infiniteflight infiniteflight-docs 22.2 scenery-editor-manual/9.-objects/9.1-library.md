\+++ Bundles

Various bundles are available to save Editors time by inserting a group of objects that are typical for a particular location, for example the "Remote Parking" contains the objects that are typically found at remote parking locations. Custom bundles can also be made and shared by following the below steps:

Step 1

: Add the objects that you would like to bundle together *(see 9.2.2 below)*

> Buildings cannot be added to bundles and any changes to scaling will not be saved within the bundle

Step 2

: Tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to select all the objects (a white box will appear to show the catchment area). All blue dots that represent each object will turn magenta to show the objects that have been selected

Step 3

: Tap "File" and then "Save Selected as Bundle" on the left of the screen

Step 4

: Name the bundle and then tap "OK". The bundle will appear under "Bundles" in the "Library" on the right of the screen

Step 5

: Any bundle can be shared by selecting the bundle from the "Library" and then tapping "File" and "Share Selected Bundle" from the left of the screen

\+++

\+++ Airplanes

Different aircraft types are available, these can be used as place holders to ensure other objects allow aircraft clearance (such as when placing objects close to a parking location)
