Welcome to the New Year Event hosted by @Butter575! This event will be hosted in the new year of 2023 and is hopefully the first flyout of the year! The event airport will take place at one of the largest airports in the world that’s hosts an even larger New Years Eve party! I hope you can join me and see everyone there!
