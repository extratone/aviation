# Birthday Bandits

Multiple Bandits have been spotted inbound over the North Pole and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) aircrafts have been assigned to scramble and intercept the Tangos, identify them and escort / protect them until landing if determined as not a threat.

If identified as a threat, dog fight them until down or out of airspace.

More infos to come...
