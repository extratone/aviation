# Original Post

---

The Infinite Flight World Tour is an extensive event that’ll require pilots to circumnavigate the entire globe with the Boeing 757-200. The World Tour offers a variety of routes to choose from, each with different challenging and scenic stops along the way. This event is a great way to test your flying skills and explore new parts of the world! On this route you’ll achieve approximately 85hrs flight time, visiting 30 country’s, covering a total distance of 34,400nm! Not to mention the potential 50,000xp up for grabs...

> ## **Summary**

So, how will it work? The concept is really simple. The general idea is for you to take your very own 757 on a round trip of world without using any other aircraft. Below is a map featuring all of the airports we will fly to in this event. We will depart eastbound from London Heathrow airport stopping at over 30 countries around the world until we eventually touchdown back at London Heathrow!

[details="continue reading the event summary..."]

The reason why we've chosen the 757 for this event is simply because of its versatility. It really does allow us to squeeze into the smaller airports down route whilst also providing us with power and the long range capabilities that we need. As this is the featured aircraft for this event, we kindly ask that you stick to using it!

**Every Monday** we will publish the next weeks worth of routes in the `routing > This weeks routes` section. We will then continue this cycle until the final week where we fly the last few legs back to Heathrow. This world tour really opens up the opportunity to see places you've never seen before from 35,000ft. Along the way you can also expect to see *some* [live-streams](https://www.youtube.com/c/InfiniteFlight).

`This weeks routes` will display the leg number, route, flight plan, date & time of the flights. We will aim to keep the timing of the flights as consistent & convenient as possible. Understandably, time-zones are very hard to cater for. However, you are of course welcome to follow along on this journey at your own pace! The `view all 43 routes` section highlights all set routes and they'll be checked off as we make progress.

This is a **BIG** event and there's no doubt that it'll take a while to complete. We're predicting that this event will take roughly two months to complete. Although this seems like a snails pace, we have to keep other official events in mind along the way.

> ## Server

This is an ALL SERVERS event. However, we encourage both pilots and ATC to use the BETA Expert Server as the main server. Staff will initially lead the flights on the beta server to help test new optimisations with a large number of pilots. If you wish to follow along on the training & casual server, you are welcome to do so!

---

Dan | 2023-01-04 16:08:37 UTC | #18

In theory you could pick your own livery to take around the world. However, we'd recommend using the IF livery!

Dan | 2023-01-04 16:29:53 UTC | #40

Good question! This is something we had taken into consideration when planning the event. However, there's no way of us being able to track this data accurately. Instead we decided to do giveaways along the way :)

---

EnthusiasticAviation | 2023-01-04 16:31:40 UTC | #41

This is streamed or independent?

---

Zhopkins | 2023-01-04 16:32:27 UTC | #42

I believe some flights will be streamed.

---

Zhopkins | 2023-01-04 16:32:45 UTC | #43

Any hints as to what the giveaways are? 👀

---

EnthusiasticAviation | 2023-01-04 16:34:31 UTC | #44

Andrew_Sanchez | 2023-01-04 16:37:06 UTC | #51

Clothing! I like that! I already wanted to buy some If clothes. But maybe I get some for free with these giveaways. Are these giveaways organised in the discord server?

---

EnthusiasticAviation | 2023-01-04 16:37:57 UTC | #52

Grover_Giraldo_PE | 2023-01-04 16:44:18 UTC | #58

The B757 is good for long-haul flights, I say this because I have done flights between Tashkent and London on the Uzbekistan Airways B757 that last something like 8 hours. Leaving that aside I hope I can participate in this event that looks very cool :)

---

HumbertoCanepa | 2023-01-04 16:44:52 UTC | #59

Okay so no Mexico???

BennyBoy_Alpha | 2023-01-04 16:48:03 UTC | #60

They can’t include every country…

---

Dan | 2023-01-04 16:49:16 UTC | #61

Not this time around. However, this opens up the opportunity to do a part two of this event in the future with a new set of routes :)

Should I still sign up if I can make most but not all the legs. A lot of them i probably can do but i probably can’t do all

*estou começando agora minha viagem... cumprindo o primeiro voo PP-BNO estará nesse evento*

---

John_Wixk_jr | 2023-01-04 18:15:57 UTC | #80

I definitely try and join in some the flights. Especially when comes to flying to my home country Jamaica.

---

Dan | 2023-01-04 18:18:42 UTC | #81

Absolutely! Still sign up even if you only intend on joining a few flights. They still count as participating! 😁

---

EnthusiasticAviation | 2023-01-04 18:21:16 UTC | #82

Do we have to keep the same livery for the whole duration?

---

Dan | 2023-01-04 18:22:18 UTC | #83

That’s the plan yes. The idea is that you take one specific plane around the entire world. We’d recommend using the Infinite Flight livery

---

EnthusiasticAviation | 2023-01-04 18:24:09 UTC | #84

Then the IF livery it is ;)

---

Dan | 2023-01-04 18:24:08 UTC | #85

Awesome! That’s what we’ll be using & including in social media posts for this event

---

AESEC_X | 2023-01-04 18:24:27 UTC | #86

Awesome I’ll register then!!

---

Ken_wei | 2023-01-04 18:43:11 UTC | #89

I’ll definitely join the first flight

---

Shamrock85 | 2023-01-04 18:47:05 UTC | #90

Fantastic idea!  With my work schedule, I won’t be able to fly at the right time but I will do as much as I can and hopefully be there for the final sector!

---

Guillermo_313 | 2023-01-04 19:02:29 UTC | #91

Please, is possible incluide more airports in the Caribbean?…  because of all in the 43 routes, there is only one airport (MKJS)

For example

MUHA, TNCM, MDSD, MMUN

Thanks 🙏

---

Dan | 2023-01-04 19:04:17 UTC | #92

Awesome! Welcome to the community :)

---

Dan | 2023-01-04 19:05:10 UTC | #93

If we do a part two we will be sure to feature other destinations! 😊

---

Guillermo_313 | 2023-01-04 19:10:45 UTC | #94

Thank you Dan

Its a amazing idea and I registered for the World Tour

Let's fly

---

Koushal_Choudhary | 2023-01-04 19:17:36 UTC | #95

The best part is almost all the flights are short hauls .. that makes it more interactive and fun

---

Mayank_Pawar | 2023-01-04 19:33:01 UTC | #96

What has been marked as Kathmandu VNKT is actually New Delhi VIDP.😉

---

Dan | 2023-01-04 20:06:09 UTC | #97

Ugh.. we’ll roll with it 😎

---

Mayank_Pawar | 2023-01-04 20:16:50 UTC | #98

As you say!💯✌🏼

---

Czech.Aviator | 2023-01-04 20:17:40 UTC | #99

Excited to join! Cant pass up such a way to gain landings and log many more flights than before :]

---

xdbeanboi | 2023-01-04 20:50:57 UTC | #100

LETS GO!!! KDEN is on the world tour! When watching the video I was scared because I didn't see Denver. Let's go Coloradans!!

(I'm excited for the whole thing but I'm just happy that KDEN is featured in this big of an event!)

---

Brandon_Biaesch | 2023-01-04 21:41:54 UTC | #101

On the map graphic, it shows we are planning to stop in LAX and LAS but in the flight lists, I see Vancouver listed instead. Are we planning on going to Vancouver or LAX and LAS? Just wondering.
