*"Hey Siri, play Jess Glynne - Hold My Hand..."*

Hello Infinite Flight pilots, welcome to another Flash Flight! Today we'll be taking a slightly longer route than usual from Manchester to Athens, Greece. Expect some awesome views as we soar eastbound across europe, especially when we reach the alpine mountain range. With that said, fasten your seatbelts, grab your device, file your flight plan and prepare to blast out of the UK. We look forward to flying with you!

IFATC will provide service where able, so remember to always be in contact with them if they are open. This includes centre and departure frequencies.
