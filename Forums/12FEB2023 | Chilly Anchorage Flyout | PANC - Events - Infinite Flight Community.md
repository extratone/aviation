Any chance I could reserve both? The C208 flight is only 35 minutes.

Thanks for hosting the event! Wish there were 3D topography to showcase the mountain-scape of the area!

JMacMcd | 2023-01-09 03:18:00 UTC | #29

yeah sure, I'll adjust it

---

JMacMcd | 2023-01-09 03:18:51 UTC | #30

I could sign you up for both, but the airport will be empty most likely after about 20 mins. So I'm not sure if you'd make it back to the event for the second flight. You still want both?

---

Chillin907 | 2023-01-09 06:02:44 UTC | #31

Yes please, I’d probably depart in the 208 a few minutes early then

Hello everyone, sorry for the inconvenience but i'm going to have to change the time for the event. But I'd like to ask what you guys would prefer first. Would you prefer to keep it at the same time and same day of the week but just a different date. Or would you guys just like it at any reasonable time on the weekend? Thanks!

---

United403 | 2023-01-11 17:30:09 UTC | #39

Same day for me. But later. I have work till 1pm mst

JMacMcd | 2023-01-11 17:32:17 UTC | #41

If most people say same day. I'm probably looking at the 25th of February for the new time. Its still a Saturday and we can keep it at the same time too.

---

Ryan_Carney | 2023-01-11 17:36:22 UTC | #42

---

AxolotlsMaster | 2023-01-11 19:38:41 UTC | #43

Same day and time work for me as I’m joining from Europe

---

JMacMcd | 2023-01-11 19:44:27 UTC | #44

I'm also looking at a Sunday but same time. What do you guys say to that? (12FEB)

---

Aiden_Hodges | 2023-01-11 20:34:26 UTC | #45

If we can do the weekend that's better as I have school until 3:30 PM Mountain Standard Time.

---

XXTHUNDERDOMEXX | 2023-01-11 21:36:07 UTC | #46
