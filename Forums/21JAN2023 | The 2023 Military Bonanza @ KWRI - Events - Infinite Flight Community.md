**Summary:** Welcome aboard, as we begin the first flight of the 2023 Military Bonanza. This event celebrates 114 years of military aviation by flying to bases across North America in various military aircraft. We begin our journey on the East Coast, at McGuire AFB in New Jersey (KWRI), and fly south to MacDill AFB in Tampa, Florida (KMCF). My goal for this is to reach Eielson AFB, just south of North Pole, Alaska. (PAEI)

**Server**: Training Server

**Airport**: *KWRI-KMCF*

**Time**: 2100Z

**Aircraft List:**

For realism, the C-17 Globemaster III, McDonnell-Douglas DC-10F (KC-10 Extender), Boeing 757 (Generic), and Boeing 767 (Generic) can be used. In addition, to simulate the KC-135R/T Stratotanker, the Airbus A340 (Generic) can be used. Of course, this is only *strongly* suggested, you can fly any USAF aircraft. Although to keep a little realism, please donâ€™t fly Air Force One/Two or the USAF 737.

For realism, the C-17 Globemaster III, McDonnell-Douglas DC-10F (KC-10 Extender), Boeing 757 (Generic), and Boeing 767 (Generic) can be used. In addition, to simulate the KC-135R/T Stratotanker, the Airbus A340 (Generic) can be used.

ðŸš¨Warning: Rant incoming.ðŸš¨

To elaborate on this, McGuire AFB is host to 13 Boeing C-17 Globemaster III, a whopping **32** KC-10 Extenders, and an unknown amount (2-6) KC-135 Stratotankers, along with a few KC-46 Pegasus aircraft, an unknown amount of unmarked Boeing 757-200s, and lots of helicopters. Due to the KC-135 and KC-46 Pegasus aircraft not being in-game, users who want to fly the aircraft can use the Airbus A340 (Generic) for the Stratotanker, and the Boeing 767-300 (Generic) for the Pegasus.

Ok rant over. Here are some notes and restricted aircraft to keep some level of realism.

For the 757, the generic livery is used.

Air Force One and Air Force Two are currently **restricted** from flying out of here, as well as the USAF 737.

All fighters are currently restricted.

Also yes the C-130s can be flown too.

Quick question: so why are the C-40 and C-32s being PNGâ€™ed from the event? Real world a/c, flown by real live USAF pilotsâ€¦

Just curious..

Thnx in advance

I think this is a great event but I think youâ€™re severely limiting participation with the restrictions you have in place. Talk about an opportunity for training in its namesake server to have refueling and fighter escorts along the route. I still think you have a great event donâ€™t get me wrong but if realism is what youâ€™re after then Iâ€™d say itâ€™s also unrealistic to have all of those aircraft following the same route on the same day at the same time circumnavigating the globe on tax dollars.
