Hello there!

![]()

A few months back, Alaska Air Group had announced by the end of Q1 2023 its DASH8 Q400 fleet will be retired, making Alaska Horizon an all jet fleet of E175s.  Many sources I‚Äôve seen are pointing to January 2023 as the final month of in service operations for the Q400s.

So after countless years of them humming overhead around the Pacific Northwest and a slightly outside of it, I thought we should give them a send off of sorts.  That‚Äôll be in the form of a massive Q400 flyout from Seattle.

## Further Event Details

Time: 2000z

Where: KPDX

To: KSEA

Server: Expert

Aircraft: Dash8 Q400

Livery: Horizon (it‚Äôs **not listed as Alaska**, or Alaska Horizon, **just listed simply as Horizon**)

## The Route

The last revenue flight will be from Spokane to Seattle and the final flight with staff will be the following day.  So we‚Äôll be doing an IF Q400 flight from Portland (KPDX) up to Seattle (KSEA), as both airports are large and close together as well as being big in Alaska Horizon‚Äôs Q400 network.

**The FPL will be made the day of**, since whenever this is posted will likely be too far out to have an accurate FPL.

## Gates

Why gates for an event like this?  It‚Äôs just so there‚Äôs no conflict over who gets what spot and no one‚Äôs having issues spawning in on each other.

## **Important**

\-pictures/screenshots were taken by me, that‚Äôs why there isn‚Äôt any credit underneath the photos, because i gave myself permission to use my own photos.

\-I am not responsible for violations achieved during the event.

\-If ATC can‚Äôt be acquired, then use Unicom respectfully and wisely.

\-pretty important, and once again, the livery is listed as ‚ÄúHorizon‚Äù I‚Äôve seen people have trouble finding it since they‚Äôre looking for ‚ÄúAlaska‚Äù

.

~If there‚Äôs any mis-formatting, do let me know and i can try and fix it~

I ªll take this! I might only be able to depart due to me having to be on the way/be at the airport during said time. I ªll be on the east coast. (Yes I know I booked my flight for 7:15 AM)

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-11-04 00:49:16 UTC | #9

Yes, yes you can and I‚Äôll get you down for one shortly!

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-11-04 00:51:36 UTC | #10

I can get you down for the unclaimed gate

From what i can tell, you‚Äôre saying you might fly while you yourself are airborne in real life?

---

flyin_hawaiian | 2022-11-04 00:52:16 UTC | #11

Yep! Doing it on my second leg too, that one is a long haul ü´£

Thanks!

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-11-04 22:59:55 UTC | #26

Small possible issue here.  There‚Äôs some talk around my family of going somewhere around new years.  If I get confirmation we‚Äôll be away and/or it‚Äôs a travel day on the 1st, then I‚Äôll be delaying it to the 8th at the latest.  Nothing confirmed yet, just some possible changes.

January 1 2023 still remains right now

---

j_asonalk | 2022-11-05 01:13:20 UTC | #27

Id Love to sign up, put me at any gate thanks

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-11-05 01:21:57 UTC | #28

Alright, I've got you down as the first person to be assigned to the B Gates!

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-11-05 02:05:22 UTC | #29

Ok, can confirm I'm still on for Jan 1st.  no change is needed!

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-11-05 04:26:01 UTC | #30

Due to seemingly popular demand, I'll be adding C Gates to make way for more slots!

---

EUG_Aviation | 2022-11-05 20:58:15 UTC | #31

The last flight is on January 27.

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-11-05 20:59:54 UTC | #32

Did Alaska themselves release that?  If so, link?  I‚Äôd like to look into it more

---

EUG_Aviation | 2022-11-05 21:51:33 UTC | #33

I messaged them on Instagram about it

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-11-07 17:20:03 UTC | #34

That‚Äôs probably why I haven‚Äôt seen that anywhere, since it‚Äôs not necessarily public

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-11-08 20:03:55 UTC | #35

Event bump

there's tons of slots left still!  Let's get some signups!

---

AviationPhu | 2022-11-10 04:52:49 UTC | #36

I‚Äôll get B2 please

AIDAN101 | 2022-11-10 04:54:52 UTC | #37

With that, A and B gates are full!

C gates remain

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-11-11 17:20:31 UTC | #41

Currently N447QX, the specific Horizon Q400 that the one in IF is based on, has yet to be sent to the desert and is so far still flying for the airline today

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-11-14 17:35:23 UTC | #42

Bump

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-11-18 16:25:07 UTC | #43

About a month and a half to go!  Let‚Äôs get some signups!

---

Mason_Literski | 2022-11-18 20:06:49 UTC | #44

C1 please im going to boise

---

Butter575 | 2022-11-18 20:08:38 UTC | #45

This isn‚Äôt a flyout. It is a group flight

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-11-18 23:09:26 UTC | #46

The send off is KPDX-KSEA, from there you can go to Boise but the main event here is a group flight on the mentioned PDX-SEA route

Would you still like a gate or no?

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-11-19 20:41:04 UTC | #47

Still interested in a gate, even if it's not a flyout?

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-11-24 18:04:55 UTC | #49

Let‚Äôs get some signups for one of the last widespread passenger turbo prop fleets in the US!

---

Topgottem | 2022-11-27 03:10:14 UTC | #50

Its so sad. I‚Äôm glad I could fly on such a interesting plane..fr lol.

I would love to join! Can you sign me up for gate **C9**?

---

AVMEX | 2022-11-27 03:14:02 UTC | #51

Hey! Nice event, would like to take GTS if possible.

\-IFATC Specialist AVMEX

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-11-27 03:19:08 UTC | #52

And GTS can be yours!

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-11-27 03:20:20 UTC | #53

It is.  I've been on it twice not knowing it'd be my second to last and last times

If it's ok with you I'd rather get you in for C1, since it's closer to the rest of the claimed gates

---

Topgottem | 2022-11-27 03:21:29 UTC | #54

Ye sure thats oke too!

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-11-27 03:21:49 UTC | #55

THEODORE_COSTELLO-KR | 2022-12-01 17:40:34 UTC | #59

I'm from Portland so I know the Q400 well

---

flyin_hawaiian | 2022-12-01 17:44:41 UTC | #60

So do you want a gate?

---

THEODORE_COSTELLO-KR | 2022-12-01 17:45:50 UTC | #61

I'm not in expert yet got 20 more landing

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-12-01 18:00:32 UTC | #62

So that‚Äôs a maybe

---

THEODORE_COSTELLO-KR | 2022-12-01 19:26:01 UTC | #63

yah if can get the 20 in before january

---

flyin_hawaiian | 2022-12-01 19:27:27 UTC | #64

Just do pattern work at any airport, I've done more than 20 in a hour at KLAS

---

THEODORE_COSTELLO-KR | 2022-12-01 20:25:01 UTC | #65

I'll try that maby in casual so I can overspeed.

---

THEODORE_COSTELLO-KR | 2022-12-01 20:26:04 UTC | #66

FYI I fly under a diffrent name

---

flyin_hawaiian | 2022-12-01 20:26:29 UTC | #67

why do u need to overspeed? just do a pattern for a while in a F-18. Just get up to as much as u want then just repeat the process.

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-12-01 20:27:58 UTC | #68

there's still a month so there's not a whole ton of pressure

---

THEODORE_COSTELLO-KR | 2022-12-01 23:14:05 UTC | #69

ok just in case save a gate any one I will tell you later

---

Ted_Costello-Krakows | 2022-12-02 00:00:00 UTC | #70

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-12-02 00:19:10 UTC | #71

i'm sure there'll be a gate available, but i'd like to give it to someone who has definite ES access

so can you let me know when you get ES access?  I can put you down then

---

Ted_Costello-Krakows | 2022-12-02 04:56:20 UTC | #72

Sure you can put me down, but it is still only a maby

This is THEODORE_COSTELLO-KR

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-12-04 01:38:54 UTC | #73

how about you just tell me when you get to grade 3, because it doesn't make sense to put you down for something you can't access yet

there'll still be gates, so don't worry about not getting one by the time you get to grade 3

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-12-06 17:22:41 UTC | #74

Just about 4 weeks to go

---

harrisonsauter111 | 2022-12-06 18:47:52 UTC | #75

I am afraid I can not make it sorry.

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-12-06 19:17:37 UTC | #76

All good!

I‚Äôll get you off the gates list

It‚Äôs a Q400 send off not an E175 send off

If you want to fly out of PDX in an E175, I do got a PDX flyout about a month after this

Last flight of the QX Q will be Jan. 27, SEA-PDX. it‚Äôll be on 421QX, our beloved meatball. It‚Äôs an employee only flight tho, and I didn‚Äôt get a seat :(

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-12-16 05:15:45 UTC | #92

noted... noted...

I made this event back when it was only January and "Q1 2023" as the retirement window

fitting though to catch wind the Meatball will be flying it!

---

Can I get this gate?

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-12-16 05:24:07 UTC | #94

Yes you can

I‚Äôll get you down shortly or in a few minutes

---

Qatari777YT | 2022-12-16 06:30:15 UTC | #95

going to feel kind of sad when the Q400 goes, it was the only commercial aircraft that served the airport where i lived now it's just E-175's.

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-12-16 17:11:07 UTC | #96

Does anyone know if I were to delay the event to 28th/29th weekend (the same week the Q400s are actually being retired) would it be within the 60 day rule?  It says any delays must be within 60 days but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs from the date the event was published or from when it‚Äôs delayed (if that makes sense)

---

iiMaximo11 | 2022-12-17 05:07:58 UTC | #97

ill take C17

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-12-17 05:21:10 UTC | #98

and so gate C17 will be yours!

---

AIDAN101 | 2022-12-18 00:55:12 UTC | #99

I would postpone this to the weekend of 28/29 (the weekend just after the actual retirement) but I believe doing so would break the 60 day rule

Also event bump

---

john_frank | 2022-12-19 04:47:55 UTC | #100

May I use the a320 which is also being retired to fly Boise to Seattle to vancover

---

flyin_hawaiian | 2022-12-19 04:48:47 UTC | #101

no. it is a Q400 sendoff, not a A320 sendoff.
