*Lake Tahoe, California*

Welcome to the Unofficial Takeoff and Landing Profiles guide for the Boeing 757! This gorgeous aircraft comes with two powerful engines to get you off the ground at airports with runways as short as 5700ft. With this power, its important to understand how and when to use these engines as well as the flaps to its max in short field situations.

This brief guide should get you into the air as well as on your way to a successful landing in just a few minutes. The table below should be pretty self explanatory for the most part, but please don't hesitate to ask any questions you may have. Please read through the notes sections throughout the topic as well as at the end of this tutorial for further clarification on some of the items found within the table.

> #### Bonus:  There is a Quick Reference Guide at the end of this tutorial. You're more than welcome to download and save the PDF for imminent and future use.

## Purpose:

The purpose of this guide is to provide you with ball park speeds, flap settings, and power settings to get you in the air and onto the runway in one piece. These values are not 100% accurate as each flight is different. Weather, airport elevation, weight, runway length and other factors will affect your these values.

---

## Conditions:

Tests were conducted at Honolulu International Airport (PHNL) /// **Airport Elev. 13ft** \\\

- Winds Calm
- Runway 08R
- Temperature Standard (15ÀöC)
- All initial pitch angles were 15Àö nose up until 1000ft. AFE (Above Field Elevation) before pitch was dropped to increase speed
- Heavy Departure/Landing conducted at 98% load. Adjust as necessary.

- Landing flare pitch **should** be about 2.5Àö nose up.
- Descent rate **should not** exceed -1000ft/min on final approach

---

> ****Note:** *Depending on the length of runway, weight, terrain and other considerations, a higher flap setting may be desired.*

> > **Extra note:** *At airports such as KSNA, KSAN and KDCA where the 757 has operated IRL, Flaps 15 were predominately used due to runway length. PHLI departures would use Flaps 20 due to heavy transpacific loads and short runway use. Be cautious of aircraft weight and use an appropriate amount of power for takeoff.*

> *****Heavy Departures/Landings:** *Takeoffs over 75% may result in takeoff over Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW). This may also result in runway overruns. This could lead to overweight landings depending on your configuration. Consider all factors and risks.*

> **‚Ä° Note:** *APPR is disabled for landings greater than the load below for where the Maximum Landing Weight (MLW) lies:*

- > 64%

---

## Flaps:

For reference the flap and various limitations for each setting are listed below. These can also be found in the cockpit of the 757 on the flap indicator gauge, to the left of the gear lever.

| Flaps | Speed Limitation |

|---|---|

| 1 | 240 kts |

| 5 | 220 kts |

| 15 | 210 kts |

| 20 | 195 kts |

| 25 | 190 kts |

| 30 | 162 kts |

---

## General Notes:

- > *For 25-50% loads, Flaps 5 was used for data*
- > *For 75-100% load, Flaps 15 was used for data*
- > **"Airborne By"** indicates a speed that you should be off the ground no later than. By the time you reach this speed, you should be in the climb and gear in the retraction process.
- > **Takeoff Power -** The first percentage is your throttle amount. The second value is the N1 read out as indicated in green above your throttle.
- > **100% throttle should never be used.** Aircraft in the real world very rarely exceed 100% as this is mainly used for emergencies only.
- > 25% trim was used to conduct these tests

> **Note:** *Fuel flow, thrust and other aircraft performance factors may apply.*

## Boeing 757 QRG:

If you would like a quick reference guide, you're more than welcome to utilize this one that I've condensed into a 1 page sheet. It has just about everything you'll want to know in terms of *"What do I use for takeoff/cruise/landing?"* and *"When do I add/remove flaps or power?"*. Below is a screenshot of what this document looks like as well as a PDF download link for that crisp picture and saving for future use.

## Questions?

Feel free to add any questions or other helpful tips/pointers that you may find beneficial to others and myself or our helpful community members will gladly address those.

Please also check out other guides I have created for other recently new/reworked aircraft. I plan on making this "unofficial" series a regular thing as aircraft are reworked or new from the factory as a handful of folks seem to appreciate the quick start information.

Wonderful guide, I'll be using this when I fly the new 757!

[quote="DeerCrusher, post:1, topic:510903"]

At airports such as KSNA, KSAN and KDCA where the 757 has operated IRL, Flaps 15 were predominately used due to runway length.

[/quote]

Does 757 need to use extra flaps at KSAN, I was under the impression the runway was more than long enough for a 757.

Michael_Eble | 2020-12-15 22:57:21 UTC | #17

What changed with APR mode? Landing on altitude and speed, ‚ÄúLOC Alt‚Äù illuminates on the APR mode button üò©

---

DeerCrusher | 2020-12-15 23:38:28 UTC | #18

Hey Michael!

Great question! When APPR mode is tapped on, it arms LOC and ALT. This is considered "ARMED" when LOC & GS are flashing. It will level out and hold your present altitude and heading respectively. During this "flashing orange/armed" state, you are free to adjust your altitude and heading as you wish. Climb, descent and anything else you'd like to do with the autopilot. Heading change included.

As soon as you capture the LOC, Heading will be deactivated as the AP is now in control. Altitude is still operated by you if you wish. As soon as GS lights up green, AP now has control of your vertical guidance and you can consider this "ACTIVE".

Remember, if it lights up green, you cannot adjust that aspect of flight as the autopilot is in control now. If LOC and/or GS are flashing orange, you are free to adjust as you wish.

Hope this helps and let us know if you have any further questions!

\-Matt

AviatorNikola | 2020-12-15 23:48:45 UTC | #19

What trim would you recommend using on the standard mid length flight on departure and arrival. (I realize this is highly variable on conditions).

---

DeerCrusher | 2020-12-15 23:50:17 UTC | #20

20-30% is a good range to play around with.

---

AviatorNikola | 2020-12-15 23:50:49 UTC | #21

Wow I didn't realize it was that much, thanks!

---

iaexo | 2020-12-16 03:17:37 UTC | #22

Nice work! But does anyone know where to find an actual v-speed calculator online? Like the 777-200LR, A320 family and 737-800 have.

abdul1abusada | 2021-04-04 18:51:45 UTC | #23

Thank you for making this! Very useful, and I'm using it RIGHT NOW as I am flying this B757. I do have a question though: On the 'Quick Reference Guide,' the Reversers & Taxi section, it says at 80 knots reduce to idle, and at 60 knots reversers stowed. Can you please reiterate that? It doesn't make sense to me, as of now, so I just need some clarification. Thank you!

---

DeerCrusher | 2021-04-04 19:10:48 UTC | #24

Sure thing! So at 80kts you‚Äôll start reducing from whatever reverse thrust ( ex. REV 88%) you‚Äôre using to a value closer to idle or 0%. So you‚Äôll use less engine thrust and more braking. Once at 60kts, you should no longer be using reverse thrust.

Aviation108 | 2021-04-04 19:16:03 UTC | #25

Just for clarification, Ground or Air Speed?

---

DeerCrusher | 2021-04-04 19:18:18 UTC | #26

Ground speed

Jacob_Le | 2021-08-15 00:23:17 UTC | #31

Great guide! This is gonna sound really redundant but when referring to load %s, is that a percentage of the MTOW or some other weight. Thanks!

---

MisterSir | 2021-08-15 01:26:07 UTC | #32

Whole total aircraft weight.

Panda_Aus_IF | 2022-12-03 04:28:03 UTC | #34

The KPLI recommendation was very helpful. Still don't know how you can get a 100,000kg jet to take off on a 6500ft runway.
