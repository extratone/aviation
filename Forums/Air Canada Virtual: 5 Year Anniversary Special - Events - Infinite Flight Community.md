***An Official Air Canada Virtual Event***

---

> ## Welcome!

> This year, Air Canada Virtual turns five years old! For the past five years, we've celebrated these special annual occasions together with a grand event for all community members to join and enjoy.

> This year, we're going bigger.

> In the past, we've done fly-ins, fly-outs, etc. We have the second largest country at our disposal - so large, some parts of Canada are closer to overseas countries than other places in Canada. With this in mind, we're opening up all four major hubs - CYYZ, CYUL, CYYC, & CYVR - for non-stop flying between. With other cities - Halifax, Ottawa, and more - as feeder cities.

> Join us on January 14th for a take-over of Canada's skies to celebrate this special time in our VAs history!

> ACVA pilots: You do not need to participate in the two scheduled flights below. Flying anywhere within Canada will earn you the 3x multiplier!

The *Popular Populous* is an event that the ACVA staff team will lead on [date=2023-01-14 time=12:00:00 timezone="America/Halifax"]. The route, CYOW-CYYZ, is one of Air Canada, and ACVA's busiest routes, hence being dubbed "popular" in the title. The two airports also connect the corridor where 50% of Canadians alone live, hence being dubbed "populous." Join us for this event!

The following are the details of this event:

Remember this ol' bird? The A319-100, once a retiree, now a charter aircraft. Well, almost. We often see this aircraft on our Calgary-Vancouver route, so we're sending some love to this chunky monkey and flying it in our *Mountain Climbing Event.*

The following are the details of this event:

| **Server**     | Expert Server (ES)                                         |

Air Canada Virtual was founded in January of 2018 by Sean Hickey. He brought together a team of 5 individuals from many different VA‚Äôs with many different talents. Within 5 days of opening, we had over 25 active pilots and were immediately making an impact in the community. In June of 2018, Sean decided that it was best if he moved on and put the VA in the hands of Nate. Since then, we have made many staff changes, updates & more all for the improvement of the VA‚Äôs quality by following the saying, ‚Äúquality over quantity.‚Äù That is something we believe in and stick to every day as we add things to improve this VA!

Now going onto 5 years in the community, we remain committed more than ever to improving not only our own VA, but the VA community altogether by enhancing thoughtful dialog and cooperation.

I‚Äôll be there!

Captain_Emergency | 2023-01-13 16:20:36 UTC | #13

Can we still do normal flights to the airports listed? Like not in an air Canada livery or anything, because I‚Äôm planning to fly to YYZ tomorrow

---

BennyBoy_Alpha | 2023-01-13 16:46:11 UTC | #14

Yes of course you can!

---

Captain_Emergency | 2023-01-13 16:53:42 UTC | #15

Ok thanks!

---

Luftalagi | 2023-01-13 17:01:55 UTC | #16

Would it be appropriate to fly from Austria to YYZ?

---

Evan | 2023-01-13 17:19:51 UTC | #17

Hi @Luftalagi,

We appreciate your interest in our event! Yes. You're more than welcome to fly to/from any airport in Canada/the world, and in any aircraft and livery. We encourage you to fly Air Canada liveries in light of the celebration, however, never required.

ACVA pilots will be in Air Canada liveries if they plan on filing the flight with the VA.

Evan

Swiss27 | 2023-01-13 17:48:45 UTC | #18

I was thinking to do Ottawa to Toronto with your event at 11 am with Boeing 777, is it okay?

---

Evan | 2023-01-13 17:51:33 UTC | #19

Gates are rather limited for an aircraft at such a size in Ottawa. However, if you can make it work, you're more than welcome too. Keep in mind many will be in an A220. We'll have flight plans ready to go for tomorrow's planned events. It will be up to pilots to follow them. Always follow ATC instructions regardless, if present.

RickLi | 2023-01-13 22:33:07 UTC | #25

I will fly the route I was going back home on in May 2022. YYZ - YVR - XMN

---

Captain_Mermer | 2023-01-13 22:56:02 UTC | #26

Will it be possible to simulate de-icing operations if IFATC active? Or is it recommended to taxi directly to the departure runway.

Thanks,

Captain_Mermer

---

ThatOneFloridaAvGeek | 2023-01-13 22:57:04 UTC | #27

I‚Äôd love to apply, but sadly I‚Äôm 14 :(

---

AirCanadaVirtual | 2023-01-13 23:09:32 UTC | #28

This would need to be consulted with IFATC members. We want to make sure operations stay efficient as possible, and depending on traffic levels, de-icing operations may not be feasible.

---

Captain_Mermer | 2023-01-14 00:11:01 UTC | #29

Ok copy that thanks!

---

Kat | 2023-01-14 00:57:39 UTC | #30

Time to check off another year with ACVA.

---

corgi_doodle_YT | 2023-01-14 01:09:39 UTC | #31

@Evan Happy cake day and I love seeing YYZ busy as usually it's quite empty :((

---

AirCanadaVirtual | 2023-01-14 01:22:19 UTC | #32

And every year we're more and more thankful to have you with us. Thanks for sticking around, Kat! üá®üá¶‚ù§Ô∏è

---

Evan | 2023-01-14 01:35:40 UTC | #33

Appreciate it, and as do I! Nothing more thrilling than seeing YYZ filled with diverse airlines and even more so AC liveries! üòç

---

TheSimulationGeek | 2023-01-14 03:48:00 UTC | #35

Hi everyone! Not a member of ACVA but I'll be more than happy to provide IFATC coverage for you guys! I'm gonna probably open up CYYZ in a couple hours!

Edit: I have a friend that wants to open up another airport as well. Can you guys please let me know which is the best airport for him to open?

---

TheSimulationGeek | 2023-01-14 04:11:27 UTC | #36

@AirCanadaVirtual I'm going to be CYYZ tower, and yes, you can let everyone know that I'll allow de-ice operations. If any of you have any certain requests, do let me know!

---

AirCanadaVirtual | 2023-01-14 03:56:09 UTC | #37

Hi @TheSimulationGeek,

Thank you so much for providing coverage for us! Opening any airport is always appreciated. If able, covering CYOW & CYYZ at 11AM ET for our "Popular Populous" event would be incredible. As well as our Mountain Climbing event at 4:30PM ET. Otherwise, any airport.

Thank you again!

---

FLIGHT_G_YT | 2023-01-14 03:56:33 UTC | #38

Hello @AirCanadaVirtual, üëã

By any chance will ATC be needed?

---

TheSimulationGeek | 2023-01-14 06:07:19 UTC | #39

Nevermind that, I won't be able to open CYYZ today at 1AM EST, but I'll try to open tomorrow at 11!

Someone else took CYYZ right before I did, sorry lol
