## Important note regarding ILS tuning:

You must be within a ***27nm radius of the airport*** in order to successfully tune in the ILS frequency. Outside of this range you will not be able to tune in the runway. I would highly suggest creating a FPL that has a GPS route from the end of the cone to the runway threshold and use that as a guide to align you with the runway. This will not be as accurate as the ILS but will keep you going in the correct direction.

# Helpful Tips

- To fly to a VOR from your present position, double tap either NAV1 or NAV2, depending on where which NAV source your VOR is tuned into and turn towards the arrow. Fly the course as you would an ILS.
- To fly outbound on a radial, you will need to take your heading to the VOR and either add or subtract 180 degrees to find the outbound radial.
- Once you are tuned into an ILS Approach, do not to mess with the course for that specific NAV source. Doing so will not line you up with the appropriate runway and may cause you to execute a missed approach.
- Make sure you are comfortable with these settings before flying in crowded airspaces. Practice on a solo flight or in a quiet airspace so you will be prepared when flying through an active airspace.
- Make sure you watch all video tutorials that are made by Infinite Flight on YouTube. This will help you immensely.

What is the ADF?

---

DeerCrusher | 2019-12-09 17:33:21 UTC | #3

An ADF is a type of navigation instrument. It stands for Automatic Direction Finding. What it will do is point you to the ground base station from your relative bearing. ADF's are rare in today's aviation system. VOR's ultimately took over this instrument. But as technology progressed, VOR's are now becoming a bit more obsolete and now GPS is the way of the future.

Josh_Tomaz | 2019-12-09 17:33:26 UTC | #4

oh boy

Infinite Flight just got extremely confusing.

---

Trio | 2019-12-09 17:34:39 UTC | #5

Itâ€™s much more intuitive then you would think. :)

---

Ondrej | 2019-12-09 17:35:11 UTC | #6

All the better appealing to people who have a PPL :)

---

Josh_Tomaz | 2019-12-09 17:36:14 UTC | #7

Is it possible to still fly with NAV mode though? And is it possible to fly without and by using the normal waypoints?

---

DeerCrusher | 2019-12-09 17:37:56 UTC | #8

Yes. Still possible to fly with NAV. Set up a flight plan, make sure your Source is in GPS and in the autopilot tab, click on NAV and the airplane will start following it.

---

Want to have the AP follow your FPL?

- Set up FPL
- Source GPS
- Autopilot NAV **on**

---

xsrvmy | 2019-12-09 18:54:36 UTC | #9

So just to clarify, this is used for thing like SIDs where there is a segment along a VOR radial, but during cruise we can just go back to GPS, right?

---

Chad_Garnett | 2019-12-09 19:00:59 UTC | #10

This is gonna make flying SO much more interesting. Practicing VOR navigation is gonna be a lot of fun.

---

Philippe_Gilbert | 2019-12-09 19:03:33 UTC | #11

Is there a way to know the distance that you are from a VOR?

---

Gaby_Burnei | 2019-12-09 19:03:57 UTC | #12

You lost me from ADF below :)

---

Jack_BC | 2019-12-09 19:04:39 UTC | #13

Canâ€™t wait. I know all this so off I go to practice some VOR approaches

---

Fellipe_Eduardo | 2019-12-09 19:17:46 UTC | #14

I think so if you add it to your flight plan.

---

NoahM | 2019-12-09 19:20:03 UTC | #15

What is the point of flying to a VOR and what do they do?

---

xsrvmy | 2019-12-09 19:21:05 UTC | #16

You can track a set direction (called a radial) from the VOR without going direct to a waypoint

---

NoahM | 2019-12-09 19:26:02 UTC | #17

But why would you use a VOR instead of a waypoint, sorry btw Iâ€™m just really confused about the new NAV stuff ðŸ˜‚

---

xsrvmy | 2019-12-09 19:27:18 UTC | #18

There might not be a waypoint, or you might not have the VOR itself as a waypoint. I've seen the second case in a SID once and had to do something really weird.

---

Pilot_M | 2019-12-09 19:36:27 UTC | #19

@DeerCrusher can you guys please make a tutorial on YouTube about the Avionics? That would be very helpful ðŸ˜…

---

Gaby_Burnei | 2019-12-09 19:39:02 UTC | #20

Agree , i didn't understand much :)

---

LaroseRoyce | 2019-12-09 19:43:31 UTC | #21

Infinite Flight didnâ€™t get more confusing, it got more realistic!

---

Pilot_M | 2019-12-09 19:49:04 UTC | #22

Oh when should you tune into ILS RNW?

---

How does the CRS affect nav?

---

DeerCrusher | 2019-12-09 20:53:23 UTC | #25

Course (CRS) will affect NAV in the following way.

Say you have the Honolulu VOR dialed in. The VOR identifier is HNL.

- You have HNL dialed in under NAV1. If you **double tap CRS1 it will center up** your Course Deviation Indicator (CDI). This is the green line with the arrow that will sway left or right of course.
- Why is double tapping on CRS a thing? Well, double tapping this will center up the CDI and the arrow will point you in the direction of the VOR. You can now go direct to the VOR from your present position.

You can manually steer the plane to the course, or you can select Source NAV1 and then click on NAV in the Autopilot menu, and the aircraft will automatically turn towards and track this course inbound to the VOR.

---

Jonathan_limento | 2019-12-09 21:27:43 UTC | #26

If we canâ€™t tune into the GPS, what do we do on GPS approaches?

---

Eugene_Leybovich | 2019-12-09 21:38:03 UTC | #27

Select the destination airport. Click runways and choose the runway of your choice to setup nav 1 for ILS approach. This is awesome, much more realistic!

---

DeerCrusher | 2019-12-09 22:10:24 UTC | #28

This was something that was talked about during the testing. GPS approaches are converted into now visual approaches... kind of. If the airport supports waypoints, meaning there are waypoints along the approach course, click on a few waypoints that will align you with the runway. We no longer have vertical guidance with GPS approaches. ILS approaches will be guiding you down to the runway now.

This is more realistic because in order to fly a GPS approach you'd actually have to tune in the approach into your GPS unit. GPS approaches don't magically tune in themselves when flying in the real world. Maybe in future updates this will be reevaluated, but in the meantime, GPS approaches = Visual approaches.

**Note**: Because of this, do not report an airport in sight if you're flying a visual approach. Only report "field in sight" if ATC clears you for the visual approach. The procedures for the GPS approach will be similar in terms foundational flying skill to a visual approach but is not the same.

Gaby_Burnei | 2019-12-09 22:22:18 UTC | #29

Will the VORâ€™s or NDBâ€™s affect the Flight plan in Any Way ?

---

DimitriB | 2019-12-09 22:23:44 UTC | #30

if they are just in your flight plan, they won't affect anything and will act as normal waypoints. They can only affect your FPL if you are using VOR/NDB navigation

---

DeerCrusher | 2019-12-09 22:26:24 UTC | #31

Exactly right! They can only affect your FPL if you're suing them for navigation purposes.

---

Esaacc999 | 2019-12-09 22:26:30 UTC | #32

Whatâ€™s the point of APPR mode now if you can tune an ILS frequency into your NAV1? Also when I try to fly and approach by the ILS frequency I have tuned in, it doesnâ€™t correctly like me up with a runway at all

---

DimitriB | 2019-12-09 22:27:34 UTC | #33

you taught me something ;)

---

DimitriB | 2019-12-09 22:28:49 UTC | #34

@Esaacc999 i've experienced the same thing. Maybe NAV1 is only meant to be used in VOR/NDB navigation? though I am not too sure

---

Esaacc999 | 2019-12-09 22:29:44 UTC | #35

Yes thatâ€™s what I thought at first but the tutorials say to use NAV1 for ILS approaches too. But maybe you have to tune it to be able to use APPR mode? Idk

---

DimitriB | 2019-12-09 22:30:38 UTC | #36

yeh the video uses NAV1 in the 172. Idek about APPR tbh i'll need to test out how that works.

---

DeerCrusher | 2019-12-09 22:32:23 UTC | #37

The best piece of advice I can give is, spend some time and just play with it. Solo mode will be extremely useful for this as you can rewind back 20 seconds multiple times and attempt it more than once.

I know some folks don't care for Solo mode. I understand that, but this is one of those things that you want to figure out on Solo mode trying different things before using it on live.

---

Esaacc999 | 2019-12-09 23:02:38 UTC | #38

Iâ€™ve figured it out. Thanks!

---

DeerCrusher | 2019-12-09 23:05:56 UTC | #39

Hallelujah! Let us know if you have any other questions.

---

Twocflyer | 2019-12-09 23:18:28 UTC | #40

can you clear a Nav1 or Nav2 or ADF1?  haven't found an option to do that yet as I look around..

no I'm talking about the VORs you set to NAV1/NAV2... can you clear them  @DimitriB

---

DeerCrusher | 2019-12-09 23:18:04 UTC | #42

You cannot clear out a frequency from of the NAV sources. You could tune into a new VOR or ADF. Maybe this is something that is looked at.

Just so I understand, what would be the reason to clear a NAV source? Cleanliness? Just curious... ðŸ™‚

---

Twocflyer | 2019-12-09 23:19:26 UTC | #43

Just so that when im looking at the CDI needle so I don't get confused at which one to look at as they look very similar.  I was thinking I could just make them both the same VOR if clearing them is not possible....

---

DeerCrusher | 2019-12-09 23:21:17 UTC | #44

If it helps,

- NAV1 on the CDI is depicted by one solid line
- NAV2 on the CDI is depicted by two parallel lines.
- The blue lines are RMI needles and they will point to their perspective NAV sources following the same line structure as the CDI.

---

Twocflyer | 2019-12-09 23:35:41 UTC | #45

Thanks @DeerCrusher going to be testing them out very soon. I want to try the SID turn based on the Santa Monica VOR out of LAX after I arrive at LAX ...

Im a mariner and when Im navigating, I like to keep a clean display so when im not using something or its not needed anymore I like to clear it out just to clean things up so that's also a reason why I ask.  would be Nice to be able to clear them or un check them by going to the VOR by clicking and holding for a couple seconds the NAV1 NAV2 buttons or something like that

My captains always taught me to keep a tidy ship!

---

DeerCrusher | 2019-12-09 23:28:01 UTC | #46

I completely understand. If you're familiar with a VOR/DME Arc approach or at least heard of them, you're able to fly these as well. This update has stuff that you will find extremely useful IRL

---

Symplixided | 2019-12-10 00:13:41 UTC | #47

hey @DeerCrusher can you pin this post. It took me a lot of time to find this post thanks

---

Mike_Lima_Tango | 2019-12-10 01:01:00 UTC | #48

So essentially, NAV1 and NAV2 help in the final stages of the flight, when tuning into ILS or directing to a VOR or NDB because you would just tune into NAV1 or NAv2 which you set up earlier and the AP will fly you there?

---

Trio | 2019-12-10 01:02:00 UTC | #49

NAV 1 and 2 can be used to navigate as well, not only for the final phases.

---

Mike_Lima_Tango | 2019-12-10 01:03:09 UTC | #50

See that's what I'm still unsure how to do. I'm sorry if I'm a bit frustrating to deal with ðŸ˜‚ right now I'm using APPR(NAV) with source GPS to Navigate, and your saying there's another way?

---

Trio | 2019-12-10 01:04:56 UTC | #51

Have a look at this video, it explains how real world pilots use VOR stations to navigate. Cool way to get to your destination when youâ€™re flying VFR for example. Same applies in Infinite Flight now. :)

---

Mike_Lima_Tango | 2019-12-10 01:42:41 UTC | #54

Why would someone direct to VOR or NDBs?

---

Zach007 | 2019-12-10 01:53:09 UTC | #55

My mind is dying

---

DeerCrusher | 2019-12-10 01:59:53 UTC | #56

As expected. Probably one of the biggest updates since Global in Oct. '17. Completely normal. Just keep asking questions.

---

Zach007 | 2019-12-10 02:00:04 UTC | #57

Like I have no clue what the blue needles are can there possible be a video made about this.

---

DeerCrusher | 2019-12-10 02:07:40 UTC | #58

Those are simple. The blue needles are pointing to the VOR that you tuned in. If you tuned a VOR in on NAV1 the blue needle will be 1 straight line. This line will always point **to** the VOR. If you tune a VOR into NAV2 the blue needle will have 2 straight lines or the fat blue arrow. Again, it will point to the VOR you tuned in on NAV2.

If you take a peek at the screenshot below you'll see. On NAV1 I have HNL VOR tuned in. Now look at my aircraft in the mini map relative to the two VORs on the map.

The single blue arrow on my compass is pointing toward the HNL VOR. This is NAV1

Now, back to the mini map. I have another VOR to the right of my aircraft. This is the Koko Head (CKH) VOR. My blue needle for NAV2 shows a fat blue arrow

![]()

---

Again, the blue arrows will always point towards the VOR or NAV source. You cannot change the orientation of these arrows with a button. Simply turn your aircraft and these needles will move based on your aircraft location with the VORs

---

Zach007 | 2019-12-10 02:08:46 UTC | #59

Oh ok so when I set my source to nav1 it nav2 it will set my aircraft to fly to these VORS because they are locked I my Nav1 and Nav2. Why would I need to set VORS though would it be like for arrival and departure charts.

---

DeerCrusher | 2019-12-10 02:11:16 UTC | #60

[/quote]

Correct. However your Course needle, the big green arrow in the middle of your Heading indicator will also be a single green arrow or a "fat green arrow".

[quote="Zach007, post:59, topic:384752"]

[/quote]

Setting up VOR's are not required. This is something that is beneficial to folks in the pilot training IRL and would like to utilize VOR navigation. But you can set up these VOR's to fly an approach. I've done VOR/DME Arc approaches with these VOR's and it works like a charm.

---

Zach007 | 2019-12-10 02:13:41 UTC | #61

I might have to try VORS and DME approachâ€™s if I can find the airport who has one on their ILS lineup.

On to another question what is my ADF  BRG1 and BRG2 and the CRS quote something if itâ€™s already said so you donâ€™t have to say it again.

---

Trio | 2019-12-10 02:14:54 UTC | #62

The thing people will need to adapt to and learn is that you donâ€™t need navigation instruments to land.

---

Zach007 | 2019-12-10 02:16:16 UTC | #63

I see your point and Iâ€™m not trying to use auto land or navigational systems to I would rather do a Visual lineup then use APPR and GPS. Iâ€™m just trying to figure out what those mean

(Alright j donâ€™t know if this is painted towards me if not I donâ€™t mean to sound rude or mean sorry if I do.)

---

Trio | 2019-12-10 02:19:52 UTC | #64

That wasnâ€™t directed at you, that was just a general statement that was worded poorly. What I meant was that on non-ILS approaches you may need to not use navigational instruments. For example, pattern work.

---

Dennis_Post | 2019-12-10 05:23:11 UTC | #66

I canâ€™t get BRG, ETE, GS, XTRK to populate on the C172 G1000 MFD. Flight plan is plugged in and NAV is GPS. I see in pictures and videos that it should be working. Any tips on what I donâ€™t have configured properly?

---

Charles_B | 2019-12-10 06:21:19 UTC | #67

So technically, we don't necessarily NEED to dial into a VOR, right? But it is useful if we decide to fly directly to our destination airport?

---

Charles_B | 2019-12-10 06:34:18 UTC | #68

And also how do I tune OUT of the VOR?

---

Edoardo_C | 2019-12-10 07:05:31 UTC | #69

Just study a little bit like I did

---

Edoardo_C | 2019-12-10 07:08:29 UTC | #70

Yes, NAV and GPS together

---

MDoor | 2019-12-10 07:31:01 UTC | #71

The VOR functionality is a massive added aspect of realism for IF. Are they required? No. You can still make your flight plans just like you used to and can still use the VORs as GPS waypoints if the NAV source remains on GPS to follow your flight plan. The VORs can serve many more purposes than simply flying direct to a station though (if you want to get into the weeds of realism a little bit).

And to answer your other question, there is also no current way to tune out of a VOR, however you can always tune to another more relevant/different one

---

Charles_B | 2019-12-10 07:33:06 UTC | #72

Ok, I do appreciate it though and definitely use the VORs. Wanted to better understand the UI before hopping into the A350

---

Josh_Tomaz | 2019-12-10 09:13:10 UTC | #73

Is there any way to do these kind of curves with the new NAV system?

(I dont even know what these are so if someone could educate me it would be great)

---

Tochukwu_Ojei | 2019-12-10 11:10:22 UTC | #74

It would be a lot easier to understand if there's a video tutorial showcasing each button and its functions during a flight.

---

Josh_Tomaz | 2019-12-10 11:35:41 UTC | #75

Woah, so wait, now I can do this arrival? by tuning into the VOR and setting my course in Nav?

Does the D in D15 JSV Mean Distance 15? and what is HGV?

---

Fellipe_Eduardo | 2019-12-10 13:32:55 UTC | #76

@Philippe_Gilbert sorry, you really don't have to do this to know the distance, the distance you are from a VOR appears where ILS was before.

---

Fellipe_Eduardo | 2019-12-10 13:36:52 UTC | #77

HGV is a second VOR that you should use to make this arrival, it does not appear on the chart because it is far from the airport, so only the name and frequency appearing. Yes, D15 is 15NM of distance.

---

DeerCrusher | 2019-12-10 16:10:02 UTC | #78

We currently do not depict round lines on the map. Everything that you will find will have a straight line. With that said, it is still possible to fly approaches that have an ARC or turn on the approach like that.

---

NationofAviation | 2019-12-10 16:34:30 UTC | #79

Can we get a visual example of these features in use for a more clear understanding? :

By this I mean a YouTube Video

MaxedOut | 2019-12-10 17:04:12 UTC | #82

I tried to tune into an ils, and it just turned me away, what did i do wrong?

---

DimitriB | 2019-12-10 17:07:25 UTC | #83

There is a 27nm range so if you are too far away, you wonâ€™t be able to tune into the ILS

---

MaxedOut | 2019-12-10 17:08:38 UTC | #84

No, i tuned in, set it to Nav 1, set the airplane to Nav 1, and it shot me away

---

DimitriB | 2019-12-10 17:10:32 UTC | #85

Was your BRG also set to NAV1?

---

Its best to get the aircraft lined up by hand on the ILS then activate the autopilot to follow the ILS. Makes for a more stable approach and would reduce any errors that you may be experiencing.

Yes, i did that, but as soon as i set it to Nav 1, my airplane made a hard left

Did you tune into the correct runway? Idk if you were approaching an airport with another runway that could be parallel.

NAV1 is usually used for VOR/NDB navigation. Iâ€™d recommend using GPS to localizer intercept and if you want you can engage APPR or fly manually using the glide slope and centreline indicators from there

Oh, yeah! i forgot about appr mode, so i did the Nav, problem resolved!

Thanks @DeerCrusher @DimitriB

I still have 1 question, if you have gps, whats the use of Nav1, Nav2, ect?

Like I've told others, if you're not already, I would highly, highly suggest playing around with this on Solo mode. You can rewind 20 seconds multiple times and reattempt the approach without spending too much time setting up for an approach. Helps instill "buttonology". The study of button placement and how they work.

We have some folks who utilize this to help stay current in their knowledge when in pilot training IRL. With NAV 1, NAV 2 folks are able to learn how to track a VOR, fly VOR approach, Find a waypoint by a means of tuning into two VOR's and using distance from those two VOR's to find a fix.

19.4 will be most beneficial to those folks who are real world pilots or in the process of becoming one as they will find this VOR stuff very attractive. The real world application in this update took the realism level to something the mobile flight sim community never saw coming.

I have read through several times but, it would be good to actually see it in application and small learnable bits for those not in aviation. I do like the challenge of learning presented by infinite flight

I'll ask staff if tutorial is or will be in the works to cover these features before I commit to work on something.

Hello! I just did a flight, and I was wondering the follow:

While I was on right base, I had my source to GPS, and NAV was on (Which follows the FPL)

Then, I put the ILS approach on NAV1, after I did that, I put the source also to NAV1. (! APPR was not on, it was still on NAV)

Suddenly, my plane turned, to the right. I thought it was going to follow the ILS approach... But, when I changed NAV to APPR, my plane turned to the left.

So my question is: Where was my plane going when it was still on NAV?

I'm sorry if it isn't very clear...

When going from GPS to ILS, I would recommend putting the aircraft in HDG mode before changing the Source from GPS to NAV1. This will reduce any premature turns. Additionally, I would intercept the ILS at a 30 degree angle. If you were on base and asking the autopilot to do a 90 turn to intercept the localizer,

\#1 not realistic as it doesnâ€™t occur in the real world like that

---

roostbrood | 2019-12-11 15:56:11 UTC | #98

I was on right base, but not on a 90Â° angle, though.

But... Where was my plane going?

Or is it a mystery? ðŸ‘€

It was going to Disneyland. Only activate APPR when youâ€™re really close to the ILS cone

roostbrood | 2019-12-11 16:00:31 UTC | #100

Ahhh... I wanted to go to Disneyland... Fair enough...

Thank you!

@DeerCrusher . I got two questions, I think.

1. What does the statement in the screenshot mean?

![]()

2. Let's say I want to fly from one VOR to another VOR, Captain Joe explained that we need to navigate to 'From' (the present vor) before we navigate to 'To' to intercept the next VOR. Does it apply in infinite flight and how does it work?

---

DeerCrusher | 2019-12-12 17:03:19 UTC | #103

I'll see if I can explain the statement below in a way that is easy to understand, so please don't hesitate to ask for further clarification.

- Say you've got a VOR tuned in and you're flying inbound (TO) the VOR on the 090 radial. Well lets ask, what does this even mean. Flying To a VOR **on** a radial is where you're at. In otherwords, if you're on the 090 radial, you're east of the VOR. If you're on the 225 radial, you're southwest of the VOR. If you're on the 360 or 180 radial, you're north and south respectively.
- So, back to the math. You're on the 090 radial flying to the HNL VOR. Once you fly over the VOR, you're now on the west side of the VOR. Because you're flying away from the VOR now, you're on what's called the "Outbound/From" radial. You're no longer flying to the VOR.
- In Infinite Flight, Outbound/FROM radials are not depicted. Only the Inbound/TO radial is shown. Because of this, the add or subtract 180 degrees tip was written.

To recap, if you're flying inbound to a VOR on the 090 radial, once you fly over the VOR, you'll need to (in this case add 180) add 180 degrees to your current heading. 90 + 180 = 270. 270 will be the new Course heading that you will dial in with CRS1 or CRS2 *items D & E*.

---

For part 2 of your question, his explanation is noticed in my explanation above. You'l need to do +/- 180Ëš to find your "FROM" radial. Once you do this and fly on this leg for a little bit, you can then find your new "TO" radial and fly inbound to VOR #2 and then VOR #3 and so on.

Please let me know if this answered your questions. Its a little confusing but will make sense over time.
