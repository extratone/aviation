Boeing 757 Freighter

![]()

Introduction

---

Hello IFC! Today I am requesting the Boeing 757 Freighter. As you all probably know, although we got a wonderful 757 rework recently, it did come at the cost of only the 757 passenger variant being reworked, and the cargo variant being removed from Infinite Flight. The 757 freighter is a wonderful aircraft that is used by many cargo operators around the world to transport all kinds of cargo, and is currently the dominant variant that is in active service across the globe. It offers unique capabilities of being a mid-sized cargo aircraft, one of the only ones of its class, and the toughness of the 757 allows these aircraft fly to almost any airport on every continent, including Antarctica! As more passenger 757s get retired and get converted to freighters, it only makes sense for this aircraft to be added to Infinite Flight. It certainly would be a great aircraft to fly, and give more cargo options for avid cargo flyers in the sim.

[details="Fun Fact"]

Did you know that Boeing only made 80 OEM 757 freighters? Most 757 freighters are passenger variants that are converted to freighters by conversion companies such as PEMCO World Air Services, Precision Aircraft Solutions, and ST Aerospace. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jyWp3hqdy8) a video that shows the conversion process.

They should of kept the DHL 757 livery

---

Leron_Gundlur | 2021-01-20 01:03:14 UTC | #3

I miss the DHL livery but it wouldn't have made a lot of sense as the cargo variant was being removed

---

Alina_Bridges | 2021-01-20 01:04:23 UTC | #4

Yep Well they said they were doing a rework on the 757 I hope they kept their DHL livery then I would fly the plane

---

IFaviationeldin | 2021-01-20 01:09:42 UTC | #5

If you think about it, all they would need to do is add cargo door animations along with liveries cause the physics would be the same as the 752

---

lucaviness | 2021-01-20 01:16:38 UTC | #6

@Alina_Bridges ‚Äì There was never a Boeing 757-200 cargo variant in-game. It was simply one aircraft with a range of liveries, some of which are only seen on the real-world's freighter variant. They decided to rework the Boeing 757-200 passenger variant. Therefore, it would not have made sense to keep the DHL or FedEx livery, as those are only found on the cargo variant. The cargo variant may come at a later date, as stated by Infinite Flight Staff Member Tyler Shelton.

@IFaviationeldin ‚Äì The development of the Boeing 757-200F would require "a considerable amount of additional development and in some ways a new model itself." It would not be as simple as one might think.

#### See Tyler's Comment on this Below:

[quote="Tyler_Shelton, post:7, topic:497120, full:true"]

Yes, those two will be gone since UPS and FedEx don‚Äôt operate passenger services.

Like most variants in a particular family, the -200 and -200F have quite a few notable differences. The obvious being a lack of windows, cargo bay, and cargo door, however many freight operators like FedEx have refreshed their flight deck and even moved the main entry door from it‚Äôs original location. This would result in a considerable amount of additional development and in some ways a new model itself.

We know the freighter is an important variant, especially in today‚Äôs application of the B757. This may come at a later date!

karl_iszler | 2021-01-20 02:20:56 UTC | #7

I have to admit one of my biggest disappointments with IF has been when I found out they were not doing the 757F variant. Especially with cargo being as crucial as it is today, I feel like it‚Äôs so severely overlooked in the game. I love flying cargo but I also only enjoy flying the new reworked planes. That basically leaves the 777F as the only cargo variant available with the standard we expect from today‚Äôs aircrafts. Hopefully they decide to listen to those of us that care about hauling boxes around and not just people. A 757F and a reworked cockpit for the MD-11F would be heaven sent and that‚Äôs without even getting into the 767F, A300‚Äôs and the 747F.

---

Leron_Gundlur | 2021-01-20 02:27:24 UTC | #8

Yeah we really need another reworked cargo a/c badly. Make sure to vote for this so we have a higher chance of getting the a/c!

---

Jackson_Hawker | 2021-01-20 03:19:04 UTC | #9

don‚Äôt forget THE DHL LIVERY!!!

---

Leron_Gundlur | 2021-01-20 03:49:57 UTC | #10

Would be a must if this a/c is made. Maybe someone can make a livery feature request for the DHL 757F

[quote="lucaviness, post:6, topic:526309"]

Well you know as good as me what that means...

---

757plus | 2021-01-20 23:19:24 UTC | #12

Plus a reworked A330F, which I'm sure is already on the way

---

Jetcentric | 2021-01-20 23:53:33 UTC | #13

Yes...yes...yes!!!

A 757 freighter would be an absolute dream come true, we don‚Äôt have a single narrowbody freighter, the gap between the C208 and A330F is honestly pathetic

---

Leron_Gundlur | 2021-01-21 00:05:21 UTC | #14

Make sure to vote!

---

CptCali | 2021-02-09 22:39:48 UTC | #15

This would be a very important and welcome addition to the cargo fleet! Hopefully the IF team seriously considers this in the near future.

---

KBUF | 2021-06-04 19:37:49 UTC | #16

UGH i want this so bad. Especially the UPS/FEDEX/ATI/DHL liveries.

---

Skydriver900 | 2021-06-04 20:29:56 UTC | #17

I‚Äôll second that! Absolute shame cargo isn‚Äôt paid much attention. Pretty much the only operation that got the world through 2020...(Covid) but hey... üòÇ

---

Jetcentric | 2021-06-07 22:55:35 UTC | #18

Even just a half-done 757F would make me more than ecstatic in the short term... just remove the Cabin fixtures, and apply a texture over the cabin windows (like the C208).

Rollers and a large cargo door would be nice, but even just a non-animated door texture would be fine in the short term. Especially considering that we don‚Äôt have a single narrow body freighter.

(Covid Preighter Style)

Plus it might be a little easier on frames as there isn‚Äôt a cabin that has to be rendered.

karl_iszler | 2021-06-08 01:48:02 UTC | #19

Still waiting :whistles to self:

---

NL-Maxis | 2021-07-10 23:44:41 UTC | #20

Voted!

Really miss the old (and newer) cargo liveries on the 757. Hopefully we can fly those yellow and red pencils again in the nearby future :`)

---

BlueThunder08 | 2021-07-14 21:24:25 UTC | #21

They definitely have to put this back in game

---

Skydriver900 | 2021-07-14 21:37:48 UTC | #22

I am utterly shocked that they have not added it‚Ä¶. BACK!!! üòÇ #ups75f

---

BurritoLeo | 2021-07-24 15:36:58 UTC | #23

We need more love for freighter aircraft!

---

Kai_Gray | 2021-07-24 18:46:31 UTC | #24

Just like with karl reply especially when cargo and military aircraft have been so crucial in the past 2 years I do think it deserve respect and after seeing it not been reworked I feel like cargo is being left out

---

JGordon | 2021-07-24 19:42:34 UTC | #25

[quote="IFaviationeldin, post:5, topic:526309"]

cause the physics would be the same as the 752

[/quote]

Same thing with the 767-300er and the 757-300. They may not be identical but they‚Äôre close enough the pilots could fly all three at the same time ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

---

Kai_Gray | 2021-07-24 19:58:10 UTC | #26

I actually don't think pilot's need extra training going from a 757 to 767 or the other way round

---

JGordon | 2021-07-24 21:50:25 UTC | #27

Right. They are literally the same. The 767 might just be a little heavier. Other than that, the same‚Ä¶

---

Kai_Gray | 2021-07-25 10:44:02 UTC | #28

I just fell this will never come since cargo doesn't get the attention it deserves

---

Meh | 2021-07-25 11:37:49 UTC | #29

Most definitely needed alongside the 757-300

---

Kai_Gray | 2021-07-25 15:19:30 UTC | #30

For them to not do the 757F felt like they don't even care about the cargo variant and I fear when we get the 747 rework in 7 years they will only do the -400 and just leave out the cargo variant

The DHL freighter is just to good

---

Toon | 2021-09-29 07:25:51 UTC | #33

I would even go as far as saying that I would rather have the cargo variant than the Pax variant.

---

Nordavia | 2021-10-02 11:25:25 UTC | #34

IF developers should make a P2F (passenger to freighter version). One would assume, that would be the fastest way to make a cargo variant. Like in real life they need to change a few things on the passenger variant:  Get rid of a few doors and the windows. (on the p2f planes its not even uncommon to see the 'passenger heritage' ) Add a large cargo door and voila, p2f cargo is ready. I'm not suggesting that it is not a lot of work, but I like to think it would be an ideal solution balancing between the effort and the result. And we, cargo lovers would be so so happy... :) Not to mention the A330-300 P2F variant! I'm dreaming.... Bonus: they would not need to worry about strengthening the cabin floor either!

---

Leron_Gundlur | 2021-10-02 16:19:40 UTC | #35

Not really. The OEM freighter and P2F freighter aren't that different. It would still require a new 3D model fuselage with a new cargo door, covering windows, and a new interior for cargo.

---

Nordavia | 2021-10-02 17:51:49 UTC | #36

This to me doesn't seem as much work as developing a new aircraft from ground up. (while do appreciate, that it still is some time to spend on the 3D modelling side)

---

Aviatorwyatt | 2021-10-21 16:32:52 UTC | #37

Bump for FedEx,ups,and DHL

It would be so cool to see a shorter range reworked freighter so we can fly into smaller airports that the B777F can‚Äôt fit into like KSAN for example.

The retro look of the Icelandair 757F is definitely one of the prettiest liveries on this aircraft. It would be a must if/when Infinite Flight makes this aircraft.

---

UPS, DHL, FedEx and countless others needed so badly in the game to represent cargo. Hopefully this on the radar of the devs.

T1MMY4L1F3_YT | 2022-02-21 17:00:14 UTC | #95

I'll put my contribution in here.

TNT Airways was a multinational cargo airline, mostly operating out of Belgium with Belgian registered aircraft. While the 757s never flew with Belgian registrations, the Austrian registered ones (OE-) were operated by the Belgian branch.

(Old livery)

(New livery)

We already have the TNT Airways 777F in the sim, why not add it's baby brother?

No actually, the 757s went to ASL Airlines Belgium (and one to Icelandair), the 777s from TNT went to FedEx though.
