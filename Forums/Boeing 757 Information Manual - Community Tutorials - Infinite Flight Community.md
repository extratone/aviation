## The Boeing 757 Route Database

So you have chosen your livery for your flight. If you're having trouble selecting a route, see the Boeing 757 Route Database created by @CPT_Colorado

[The B757 Route Database](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/the-b757-route-database/497155?u=balloonchaser)

## Fuel Burn and Cruising Altitudes

So the flight is picked, the livery selected.. But how do we do flight planning?! With @AndrewWu's new topic - we can calculate everything that we'll need to know!

**Read @AndrewWu's Topic - 'Your Guide to Fuel Burn and Cruising Altitudes in the new 757':**

## Taking off & Landing

Taking off and landing is going to be tricky for your first couple of flights - this is because the 757 physics are spot on to real life’s. Don’t worry though, @DeerCrusher was kind enough to make us a tutorial on how to takeoff and land effectively in the Infinite Flight 757. He even made us a Boeing 757 Quick Reference Guide (down below)!

**Read @DeerCrusher’s Topic - 'Unofficial Takeoff and Landing Profiles':**

Curious as to what display is in the cockpit? Look no further! @Brandon_K has provided us all with a very detailed topic explaining each display unit and its function!

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

[details="Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)"]

---

[details="Is the Boeing 757-300 included in the 20.3 update?"]

Only the Boeing 757-200 Passenger variant is included in the 20.3 update.

[/details]

---

[details="Why did some liveries go away in the 20.3 update?"]

[quote="MishaCamp, post:1, topic:498067"]

It also means that more liveries than normal will be retired to make way for this diversity.

[/quote]

[/details]

---

[details="If I find an issue, how may I report it?”]

If you find an issue, you can report it by making a #support topic and thoroughly explaining the issue.

*Please note that most issues have already been found and reported during both our opened and closed beta programs during the 20.3 update beta.*

[/details]

---

[details="Why does the cockpit only have one model? Will this change in the future?"]

The cockpit only has the full glass screen interior right now (rather than the full glass and steam gauges). This was to save time in the development phase and was to quickly get the product in to your hands!

[quote="MishaCamp, post:884, topic:497037, full:true"]

No, just glass for now. This may change in the future

[/quote]

As stated by @MishaCamp (Staff Member at Infinite Flight), even though steam gauges aren’t in the 20.3 update, the Infinite Flight Staff and Development Team may add them into the simulator in the future

[/details]

---

[details="I really like this update... Now what?"]

**Awesome! Glad you’re loving the update! The Infinite Flight Staff Team does a fantastic job and loves hearing your opinions and comments on their app! Here’s what you should do to show your appreciation for the 20.3 update:**

1. Please be sure to leave a good review for Infinite Flight on the Apple Store or Google Play Store. These reviews help others discover Infinite Flight, and help the developers push out more quality updates just like 20.3!

**Apple Store Link:**

[‎Infinite Flight Simulator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/infinite-flight-simulator/id471341991)

**Google Play Store Link:**

[Infinite Flight Simulator - Apps on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fds.infiniteflight&hl=en_US)

---

2. Go onto the 20.3 Thread and tell the staff and development team how great of an update it was (let them know that you left a positive review on the Apple/Google Play Store - it makes them happy)
3. Take some awesome pictures of the new Boeing 757 and post your best in a #screenshots-and-videos topic!
4. Continue to fly and love this update!

Amazing booklet on the 757. This will come in handy. Il download it as a PDF and have it handy so I can study it, if and when I forget the basics of flying this beautiful airliner. Happy XMAS guys/girls

Josh_Suarez | 2020-12-31 18:04:00 UTC | #19

Nicely done. This is now bookmarked for me. Thanks for the little info guide. The only thing I would disagree with is which engine should be used for single-engine taxi (I think it should be reversed) but that’s purely an opinion. Reason being when you pull into the gate, ramp agents can start opening cargo doors on the right side of the aircraft with engine #2 already shut down.

Anyways, great tutorial!

Note: Even though the maximum range for the 757 is 4100nm, it's actually 3915nm for realistic conditions and 3850nm for max payload.

Sebastian_Arias91 | 2021-07-19 03:26:44 UTC | #22

My biggest issue with this aircraft is that the instruments are too small to read compared to which makes me want to zoom in constantly. It reduces my visual awareness and I mess up my landings
