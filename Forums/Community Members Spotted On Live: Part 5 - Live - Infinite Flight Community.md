# Community Members Spotted On Live: Part 5 - Live - Infinite Flight Community

No, thank *you*! I have been trying to make this happen for months lol. It did actually work and give you the dialog then? I suppose that's not the most important thing (somehow it's a blast just to do it and have y'all know what I was going for lol.)

I'm glad I get the opportunity to apologize for how long it took me to realize that I was going way too slow! And should have probably been flying *into* the wind instead of directly opposite.

(Turns out the ideal for the F-16 is ~M0.82, [apparently](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/aerial-refueling-tips-tricks-information/170076). We *were* at the right altitude, though.)

That said, very impressive formation flying! I suspect there's a good deal of practice behind that.

Definitely want to update this post with screenshots in a bit.

Since our two-time champions topic was closed (@Guxk), I thought I'd make Part 5 of this ever-growing series!

I think @David_Beckett beat you by a minute. Though I'm not sure why I'm saying beat, because it's neither a race nor competition...

anon2996007 | 2021-02-12 18:59:48 UTC | #11

I spot @Maxim who just took off from LHR and may have been wondering why I made a complete airport tour while taxiing to the runway I spawned next to.

---

Maxim | 2021-02-12 19:01:45 UTC | #12

I'm afraid I did not notice, I was too busy reading the departure chart, sorry! But since we're on the subject, why would you do that, lol?

---

David_Beckett | 2021-02-12 19:02:12 UTC | #13

It absolutely is a race and a competition.

I followed the path of the aircraft whose flight I am recreating right now. I don't have any clue though why it would make that taxi route because it never stopped for de-icing or something...

---

GBKarp | 2021-02-12 19:04:01 UTC | #15

if you look at the topic url you will see they are made in order of topic creation. this is 534798

We're aware. It's up to the mods to choose which one stays and which one goes.

---

Maxim | 2021-02-12 19:07:13 UTC | #18

Oh, I see! The A320 requires at least 2 minutes of engines running at near idle before applying take-off thrust, so they could have been taxiing around to do just that, but I'm not certain.

Sorry for the confusion. @MishaCamp forgot to feed @system again so it opened a topic yesterday without asking. We punished it accordingly and it will only receive half its portion of Jet-A1 for a week.

We continue "Community Members Spotted on Live" here. Congratulations @Z-Tube. Now carry on.

Thank you for the spot! I had 49kts crosswind on final (at around 2500ft). At least it got less on short final, only 11kts :)

---

Sam_D206 | 2021-02-14 19:51:59 UTC | #64

Oof. Had sudden 32kts crosswind on approach to Lisbon. And it continued all the way until landing! But its always nice to have a challenge!
