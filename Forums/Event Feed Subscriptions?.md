# Event Feed Subscriptions?

Howdy!

I was wondering if it'd be possible for the forum admins to turn on(?) the setting in the [Discourse Events plugin](Events Plugin ðŸ“† https://meta.discourse.org/t/events-plugin/69776) (which I'm assuming is being used, from what I can tell at the frontend) that would allow for a "Subscribe" link to be at the top of [the Events category](https://community.infiniteflight.com/c/live/events/16) so that folks like me who use iCal subscriptions regularly might be able to benefit. (And Google Calendar users, directly, from what I can tell.)

Obviously, if this was an intentionally omitted capability, I understand - if you guys would rather not provide the feed, I'll start work on a Siri Shortcut that just scrapes the JSON.

Thanks for your time!
