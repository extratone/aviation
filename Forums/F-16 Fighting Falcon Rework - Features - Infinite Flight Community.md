# My Opinion

In my opinion the F-16 Fighting Falcon is definitely one of the best jetfighters ever produced.

Not only in terms of designe but also because of it‘s First class performance. The numbers just talk for itself.

Did you know the F16 is already 40years in service? It does definitely not look like an almost half a century old aircraft.

By July 2010 there had been 4500 F-16s delivered.

Another fact why I do love the F-16 is that it was designed to be small and agile as well as easy to build/maintain. By that it’s the workhorse of many airdromes around the world. (Dogfighting, close ground support, intercepting, reconnaissance,...)

Last but not least one really big advantage over basically every other jetfighter is the outstanding visibility. Nothing is blocking your view except of the floor of the cockpit. 😉

# Description of the manufacturer

The combat-proven F-16 has proven itself as the world‘s most capable  4th generation multi-role fighter, serving as the workhorse of the fighter fleet for 28 [customers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon#/media/File%3AF-16_operators.png) around the world. The F-16V, the latest F-16 configuration, includes numerous enhancements  designed to keep the F-16 at the forefront of international security.

# Variants

[details="F-16A/B"]

The F-16A (single seat) and F-16B (two seat) were initial production variants. These variants include the Block 1, 5, 10 and 20 versions. Block 15 was the first major change to the F-16 with larger horizontal stabilizers. It is the most numerous F-16 variant with 475 produced.

[/details]

[details="F-16C/D"]

The F-16C (single seat) and F-16D (two seat) variants entered production in 1984. The first C/D version was the Block 25 with improved cockpit avionics and radar which added all-weather capability with beyond-visual-range (BVR) AIM-7 and AIM-120 air-air missiles. Block 30/32, 40/42, and 50/52 were later C/D versions. The F-16C/D had a unit cost of US$18.8 million (1998). Operational cost per flight hour has been estimated at $7,000 to $22,470 or $24,000, depending on calculation method.

[/details]

[details="F-16E/F"]

The F-16E (single seat) and F-16F (two seat) are newer F-16 variants. The Block 60 version is based on the F-16C/D Block 50/52 and has been developed especially for the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It features improved AN/APG-80 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, avionics, conformal fuel tanks (CFTs), and the more powerful General Electric F110-GE-132 engine.

[/details]

[details="F-16IN"]

For the Indian MRCA competition for the Indian Air Force, Lockheed Martin offered the F-16IN Super Viper. The F-16IN is based on the F-16E/F Block 60 and features conformal fuel tanks; AN/APG-80 AESA radar, GE F110-GE-132A engine with FADEC controls; electronic warfare suite and infra-red searching (IRST); updated glass cockpit; and a helmet-mounted cueing system. As of 2011, the F-16IN is no longer in the competition. In 2016, Lockheed Martin offered the new F-16 Block 70/72 version to India under the Make in India program. In 2016, Indian government offered to purchase 200 (potentially up to 300) fighters in a deal worth $13–15bn. As of 2017, Lockheed Martin has agreed to manufacture F-16 Block 70 fighters in India with the Indian defense firm Tata Advanced Systems Limited. The new production line could be used to build F-16s for India and for exports. On 25 November 2017, Sputnik reported that the Indian government wanted to remove the single–engine criteria and focus on the fighter capabilities instead.

[/details]

[details="F-16IQ"]

In September 2010, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency informed the United States Congress of a possible Foreign Military Sale of 18 F-16IQ aircraft along with the associated equipment and services to the newly reformed Iraqi Air Force. Total value of sale is estimated at US$4.2 billion.

[/details]

[details="F-16N"]

The F-16N was an adversary aircraft operated by the U.S. Navy. It is based on the standard F-16C/D Block 30 and is powered by the General Electric F110-GE-100 engine. However, the F-16N has a strengthened wing and is capable of carrying an Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) pod on the starboard wingtip. Although the single-seat F-16Ns and twin-seat (T)F-16Ns are based on the early-production small-inlet Block 30 F-16C/D airframe, they retain the APG-66 radar of the F-16A/B. In addition, the aircraft's 20 mm cannon has been removed, as has the ASPJ, and they carry no missiles. Their EW fit consists of an ALR-69 radar warning receiver (RWR) and an ALE-40 chaff/flare dispenser. The F-16Ns and (T)F-16Ns have the standard Air Force tailhook and undercarriage and are not aircraft carrier capable. Production totaled 26 airframes, of which 22 are single-seat F-16Ns and 4 are twin-seat TF-16Ns. The initial batch of aircraft were in service between 1988 and 1998. At that time, hairline cracks were discovered in several bulkheads and the Navy did not have the resources to replace them, so the aircraft were eventually retired, with one aircraft sent to the collection of the National Naval Aviation Museum at NAS Pensacola, Florida, and the remainder placed in storage at Davis-Monthan AFB. These aircraft were later replaced by embargoed ex-Pakistani F-16s in 2003. The original inventory of F-16Ns were previously operated by adversary squadrons at NAS Oceana, Virginia; NAS Key West, Florida and the former NAS Miramar, California. The current F-16A/B aircraft are operated by the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center at NAS Fallon, Nevada.

[/details]

[details="F-16V"]

At the 2012 Singapore Air Show Lockheed Martin unveiled plans for the new F-16V variant with the V suffix for its Viper nickname. It is to feature an AN/APG-83 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, a new mission computer and electronic warfare suite, automated ground collision avoidance system, and various cockpit improvements; this package is an option on current production F-16s and can be retrofitted to most in service F-16s. First flight took place 21 October 2015. Upgrades to Taiwan's F-16 fleet began in January 2017.

[/details]

[details="F-16XL"]

The F-16XL featured a novel 'cranked-arrow' type of delta wing with more than twice the area of the standard F-16 wing. Developed under a program originally known as the Supersonic Cruise and Maneuvering Program (SCAMP), the design was intended to offer low drag at high subsonic or supersonic speeds without compromising low-speed maneuverability. As a result, the F-16XL can cruise efficiently at supersonic speeds without use of an afterburner. In late 1980, the USAF agreed to provide GD with the third and fifth FSD F-16s for modification into single-seat and twin-seat F-16XL prototypes. To accommodate the larger wing, the aircraft was lengthened 56 in (142 cm) by the addition of a 30-inch (76 cm) plug in the forward fuselage and a 26-inch (66 cm) section to the aft fuselage just behind the landing gear bulkhead. The rear fuselage was also canted up by three degrees to increase the angle of attack on takeoff and landing. The F-16XL could carry twice the payload of the F-16 on 27 hardpoints, and it had a 40% greater range due to an 82% increase in internal fuel carriage. The single-seat F-16XL first flew on 3 July 1982, followed by the two-seater on 29 October 1982. The F-16XL competed unsuccessfully with the F-15E Strike Eagle in the Enhanced Tactical Fighter (ETF) program; if it had won the competition, the production versions were to have been designated F-16E/F. Following the February 1984 selection announcement, both examples of the F-16XL were placed in flyable storage.

In late 1988, the two prototypes were taken out of storage and turned over to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for use in a program designed to evaluate aerodynamic concepts for improving laminar airflow over the wing during sustained supersonic flight. From 1989–99, both aircraft were used by NASA for several experimental research programs, and in 2007, NASA was considering returning the single-seat F-16XL to operational status for further aeronautical research.

Kirito_77 | 2018-06-15 23:33:25 UTC | #3

I absolutely love this feature request.

Part of me doesn't want a reworked f16; the past year of development for Aerobatics would be useless with a new handling like

However this topic highlights such a wonderful aircraft and has earned a vote!

@Nate_Schneller @Kirito_77

Thank you very much I do appreciate that!

Especially when having the amount of time I put in this post. Just the editing of the post itself did take about 4-5 hours. The time for research Not included!

😄

Make sure to check out all liveries. There are a couple cool ones in there (wich are obviously not ment for combat but for the aerobatic teams of there countries airforce) like the USAF Thunderbirds or the Netherlands/Singapore liveries.

Asneed8706 | 2018-06-16 21:24:03 UTC | #10

FYI 'D'models can hold two crew. Usually either another qualified pilot or an instructor or evaluator pilot to over see check rides or quals on the primary pilot controlling the aircraft. Mission commanders will slot at least on D model based on maintenance availability to participate if a student or basic pilot is needing a qualifications check for either mission qual training (MQT) or basic qual (BAQ).  Also one of my first incentive flights was on a D model FA16 =) general characteristics 1-2

---

Marsiana7 | 2018-06-16 21:27:44 UTC | #11

Yes that’s true! The B, D and F version are the two seater versions wich are mostly used for flight training or for giving a passenger a ride like in the video I did post (original request post). That’s an F16D.

By the way if you wanna have a quick summary of every version just look in the original post and click on the versions you are interested in.

I can really recommend to watch those two videos!

Asneed8706 | 2018-06-16 21:31:01 UTC | #12

You hit every aspect of the Viper. Best two years of my USAF career was with the men and women of the 80th FS at Kunsan AB. I miss working with the 16 dearly but who knows where my career will land me next. Great post again! Bumping this one for sure.

---

Marsiana7 | 2019-08-28 19:50:05 UTC | #13

Well wish you good luck that you get back working with the fighting 16😄.

I did found a quote wich does perfectly fit for the F16 Fighting Falcon.

It’s by Sun Tzu. For all of you who do not know who he is,... well he is the author of the most famous book about the art of war wich is called „The art of war“.

Hey guys,

I think that all fighter jets should get a rework in IF, so I am definitely voting for this. Get the word out about this topic! Share it to everyone who plays IF.

Let's get a lot of votes on this one because it is a really good rework! Lately, FDS is only focusing on airliners, so it would be nice to have a fighter jet rework!

Good luck,

Adam

Yeah that’s true. I’ve seen someone building a super scale RC version of that Dutch demo F16.

I don’t know what you guy do think about that but do call that true passion for details and the F16!

Now livery’s would be a very nice addition to the game but if a rework does happen, I feel like afterburners should be added as well look at his for example it would add a huge amount of realism in terms of graphics

This is my fav aircraft in IF and I have almost 500hrs logged in it. This is a great feature request that has my vote.

I love the US Navy, Belgium and Italian (black and green) livery!

That Livery would be awesome to have. Who knew that the YF-16 was going to be such a huge success when it made it's unintentional test flight in 1974 on a high-speed taxi test. Props to Phil Oestricher, the test pilot for saving the aircraft. ; )

---

Marsiana7 | 2018-06-19 20:51:02 UTC | #36

Yeah heard about that „accidental“ flight xD. Found a video of it below.

[- YouTube](https://youtu.be/r05etLdeonY)

What I do like about the „light fighter mafia“ as they called themselves is that they not just test to prototypes to find out wich one is better... no they actually noticed both were really good and so interested of just building the F16 they recycled the yf17 to the current day F18.

Here is another fun fact.

Who did know that the F16 was designed to be aerodynamic unstable and is only flying „straight“ becuase of its onboard computers. This was the first time an aircraft was designed that way on intention to get the best maneuverability.

Another jetfighter wich is designed to be aerodynamic unstable ist the Eurofighter.

David_Driggers | 2018-06-19 20:59:09 UTC | #37

The U.S. Navy does not fly the F16... what are you referring to?

---

Marsiana7 | 2018-06-19 21:11:44 UTC | #38

Well they were flying the F16 as an aggressor trainer but that’s not what I did wanna say.

I wanted to say that there was two competitors for a light, cheap and highly maneuverable fighter jet.

G.D. with their YF-16 and Northrop with their YF-17. As we all knew the airforce did choose the YF-16 for their fleet.

But the YF-17 wasn’t just tossed away and ignored. They did keep on developing it wich finally ended up in the F18 Hornet for the Navy.

(That’s at least how I do remember it.)

Capt_D_Brown | 2018-06-20 16:37:38 UTC | #40

Hi David,

I'm referring to the "US Navy" livery listed on the feature request "Operators/Possible Liveries" list. It's a blue and grey camo design. I would have agreed with you that the US Navy doesn't have a F-16, until I read this post and started researching. I was surprised to find out that this is true. @Marsiana7 is correct, that F-16 is flown by the Navy as an adversary-aggressor aircraft at the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center. One place you would expert to see them is at Red Flag Operations.

I would love to fly this livery on IF and it would probably be my favorite, That squadron are the experienced veteran pilots teaching the next generation the hard lesson of combat in the air, so that survivability is increased in real combat.

There is a really cool article about the F-16N

I just hope they actually rework this and the F/A -18 like they can do such a great job on them like imagine flying in formation with a couple other F/A 18’s over the Swiss alps oh man

---

Recxx | 2018-06-21 03:28:49 UTC | #43

So far we have requested reworks on the F-18 so that it can be refueled... and now rework of the F-16 and addition of the F-15... so it will be interesting to see which one wins out in the next summer or fall update !!!

---

Marsiana7 | 2023-02-04 08:38:43 UTC | #44

I don’t think that many people voted for the rework for the F18 just to get aerial refueling on it.

But I do rather more think they did voted for the F16 & F18 Rework to see such pictures in IF rather more earlier than later.

Thing is with the F/A-18 you can barely last in the air with full afterburners for like 10 minutes the fuel consumption is just off

Marsiana7 | 2018-06-21 20:02:27 UTC | #47

Well I don’t know the fuel consumption with afterburner for the F18 but I do know it for the F16.

The F16 does use with full afterburner about 11L/second. The F16 does have an internal fuel capacity of 3.986 L.

That does mean —> 6,04min until the F16 would have burned all its internal fuel with full afterburner.

And by that I wouldn’t say it’s to much off with the F18 is empty after 10min with afterburner.

The only variation we might have to consider is the possible external fuel tanks.

One thing I would love to see is a Blue angels livery! A smoke trail would also be wonderful.

---

Marsiana7 | 2023-02-04 08:38:31 UTC | #49

There will be never a Blue Angels livery on the F16!

They did never flew any F16 in the Blue Angels Demo Team. They did only fly F18 in the last couple of years. If you wanna know more about them click [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Angels).

But the USAF Thunderbirds do fly the F16!

Marsiana7 | 2018-06-21 20:37:43 UTC | #51

Hahaha thank you 😅 but I wouldn’t consider me as an expert. Just an enthusiast!😂

I do collect my knowledge here and there and combine them in this case with the fuel consumption I did saw the video below some time ago and remembered it when this topic came up. Then I did look up how much fuel the F16 does take. Everything else is just simple mathematics!😅

---

Greg78 | 2018-06-21 20:59:00 UTC | #52

Well good job doing all the research. I haven’t tested this exacly, but our current F-16 in the simulator is good for over 20 minutes at full throttle. So the current F/A-18 is actually more realistic in this one metric.

---

Marsiana7 | 2023-02-04 08:38:27 UTC | #53

Well yes but you have to keep in mind the external fuel tanks. On normal use the F16 can carry weapons plus 2 fuel tanks. For ferry flights it can take three (one in the middle two under the wings) and that combined with an old flightmodel,... it might not be that far off.

But all this guessing,... shows how much a rework is needed!

Unfortunately with any of the fighters you only get about an hour and a half or less flying time with full fuel at between 300-500 kts...so you would still need in air refueling between PHNL and KLAX or similar distances over any primary ocean route  !!!

---

Recxx | 2018-06-21 22:41:27 UTC | #55

Just a minor correction... that quote from "Top Gun" was primarily for Navy carrier pilots flying F-14 fighters as l am probably one of the very few here who actually saw it when it was first released in 1986.... l cannot remember a movie where the F-16 was ever the primary focus unless it was a documentary on the Thunderbirds  !!!

---

Marsiana7 | 2023-02-04 08:38:27 UTC | #56

I know it was on TopGun with The F14.

But it is just so damn good that it does fit for pretty much all nice fighterjets or do you not think so?!😄

I mean they do look both gorgeous right?

Marsiana7 | 2018-06-22 10:31:10 UTC | #58

Yes of course it’s not right. I do agree but I just wanted to say it’s not that far as you might think especially using the afterburner. They are basically just dumping the fuel when using it. Even though it does make a lot of fun flying with afterburner

---

Capt_D_Brown | 2018-06-22 16:07:35 UTC | #59

It is a great quote. If we need a quote from an F-16 movie, " I thought you was a pilot, not an astronaut".

It came out same year as Top Gun, but a few months earlier. Can anyone name that movie??  XD

I always loved that movie growing up. It wasn't perfect and the story was ok, but it has my earliest memory of watching a F-16 in action. so cool! They also had some great Cessna 150M aerobatics and the feared Kfir as the enemy bandits.

---

Marsiana7 | 2023-02-04 08:37:39 UTC | #67

Well I haven’t seen it but as it does seem I do have to add it to my list! 😄

Furthermore I can’t for TopGun 2 wich does get released next year. They kinda confirmed the F18 as their choice but I am curious who/what they will choose as the antagonist!😋

I don't think it will be a remake. Either a sequel or prequel (but I don't think Val Kilmer could pull off the latter. LOL. time has not been kind to that man. Ice Man forever!). A sequel about Maverick's time as an instructor at Top Gun could be interesting. Then some kind of military conflict occurs where he is pulled back into active duty with his last batch of Top Gun trainees. I'm going to see it regardless, but a good story would be preferable.

---

Marsiana7 | 2023-02-04 08:37:42 UTC | #70

Do you guys feel that the current model in the sim does not react as fast as it should? I mean when you throw the nose up, I feel like it should really move, but it seems kinda deboosted so to say. Anyone else feel this way?

---

Recxx | 2018-06-26 13:22:17 UTC | #77

Let's put it another way... if the Thunderbirds irl aircraft had the physics of the model in this sim....they would have been grounded from all their air shows !!!

---

JovialBreak | 2018-06-26 14:18:36 UTC | #78

Yes that is very very true

---

Asneed8706 | 2018-06-26 16:09:28 UTC | #79

From having multiple incentive flights with this bird. Yes the calibration and physics/dynamics are pretty far off the mark. But its hard to get actual diagnostics and physics due to U.S. classification codes. Sure we sell variants of the 16 but we do not allow the buyers to see everything it can do. Even our allies do not have access to the entirety of U.S. capabilities due to National Security interests. So to be honest it may be difficult to replicate the actual flight physics, depending on declassifications issued for them.

---

Recxx | 2018-06-26 16:16:57 UTC | #80

The aerodynamics and other flight physics only have to be compatible with the IF sim...since we have no armaments do to deep DOD budget cuts ... the classified weapons systems are not really a factor !!!

---

Capt_D_Brown | 2018-06-26 18:15:52 UTC | #81

Well said.

That is awesome that you've been able to take a few incentive flights. I bet it was the experience of a lifetime. Were there any interesting flight characteristics that you learned about on you incentive flights? I live on the west side of  KBKF just beyond the fence, so I'm happy I get to seem them fly almost every day.

---

Asneed8706 | 2018-06-26 18:34:23 UTC | #82

Well I can tell you my last ride was over in Korea along the DMZ. We did an unrestricted climb and hit FL130 in around what seemed like lilteraly 10 seconds, we did some medium to high G passes and strafes then push up towrd the DMZ. We flew back along the western coast and I could literally see the Chinese coast on the horizon. One thing thats awesome was it only took 15 mins for our flight to reach the DMZ. Thats a heck of a response time.
