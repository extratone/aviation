**BEFORE ASKING QUESTIONS, PLEASE READ THIS POST INCLUDING THE FAQ.**

Hear over 30 co-pilot voice samples during your flight, whether it's takeoff callouts like "V‚ÇÅ", "Rotate!", or "Positive Rate", or whether it's warnings when speed limits are being approached, or confirmation callouts when setting flaps or gear settings.

[inflightassistant is for sale at Squadhelp.com!](http://inflightassistant.com)

---

**HOW IT WORKS**

Start In-Flight Assistant, then launch Infinite Flight on the same device - you will hear a confirmation that In-Flight Assistant is connected. It will now be watching your flight and be providing the callouts as you configured them within the app. It's that simple!

---

**CO-PILOT CALLOUTS**

The following callouts are provided:

- "80 knots"
- "V‚ÇÅ"
- "V‚ÇÇ"
- "Rotate"
- "Positive Rate"
- "Let's watch our speed, captain" warning when taxiing or flying too fast
- "Gear up/down" confirmation
- "Flaps at XXX degrees" / "Flaps Final" confirmations, each based on aircraft model (note that the new C-130 is supported)
- "Spoilers Retracted"/ "(Flight) Spoilers extended" confirmations. (Spoiler Confirmation)

---

**AUTOMATED GPWS WARNINGS & WAYPOINT ALERT & NAV SYSTEM (IN-APP PURCHASE)**

Experience fully-featured GPWS warning callouts such as "TOO LOW, GEAR", "SINK RATE", or "PULL UP!" - the system is in accordance with the specification of the real-world [Honeywell MK VI GPWS](https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjRufj-8rDQAhVsJsAKHRQ5Ci0QFgggMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Faerocontent.honeywell.com%2Faero%2Fcommon%2Fdocuments%2FMk_VI_VIII_EGPWS.pdf&usg=AFQjCNFNQ2aBd8YnP7FPBpFssEuKZOyLzw&sig2=8evbDJyhkMEhPs0OPvmgGg) system - with all 6 modes fully supported, including turboprop alternative settings (automatically detected whether the aircraft is a turboprop), Steep Approach Bias, Flap Override settings, and more.

Also enjoy proximity alerts to waypoints and set altitude and speed you want the autopilot to set, per waypoint. **(iOS only)**

The following callouts are provided:

- Autopilot disconnect warning sound
- "GLIDESLOPE" both quiet and loud, depending on how low you are
- "SINKRATE"
- "PULL UP! PULL UP!"
- "TERRAIN! TERRAIN!"
- "DON'T SINK"
- "TOO LOW, TERRAIN"
- "TOO LOW, GEAR"
- "TOO LOW, FLAPS"
- "APPROACHING MINIMUMS"
- "MINIMUMS" or "MINIMUMS, MINIMUMS" (configurable)
- "BANK ANGLE" based on aircraft type, altitude, speed, autopilot setting, etc.
- "RETARD, RETARD" when landing in an Airbus

---

**PASSENGER ANNOUNCEMENTS (IN-APP PURCHASE)**

Have a flight attendant be talking to your passengers at various times during the flight. You have the option to have the sound be "muffled" (sounding like it's coming through the cockpit door) or clear.

- Welcome aboard announcement right at the start
- Arm doors for departure & cross-check
- Safety briefing during pushback / taxi
- Flight attendants, take seats for takeoff when first activating strobes
- "You may move about the cabin now, etc." when reaching altitude you specify
- Descent beginning when passing altitude you specify
- "Flight attendants, prepare for landing" when reaching altitude you specify
- Welcome post-landing
- Passenger applause if you make a soft landing at less than 350 fps impact

**VOICE COMMANDS (IN-APP PURCHASE) - iOS ONLY**

Using your headset microphone, use voice commands to control many of the airplane's systems! Once it is set up, In-Flight Assistant will be listening for your voice to say things like "gear up", "set heading 2-3-0", and much more, and your co-pilot will automatically set the autopilot settings for you! It feels magical and keeps your focus on flying the plane.

*NOTE: A headset and a relatively quiet environment is recommended for best accuracy of recognizing your commands.*

*NOTE: A few users with non-American accents have been reporting some issues with the recognition accuracy especially with numbers like 'set heading' or 'set speed'. **The stronger your non-American accent, the less accurate the recognition may work for you.** After looking into it, it doesn't look like there's a whole lot I can do to improve the recognition.*

The following voice commands are supported:

‚Ä¢ "Gear up" / "Gear down"

‚Ä¢ "Flaps 15 degrees" / "Flaps 3" (based on aircraft's flaps settings)

‚Ä¢ "Set heading 1-4-5"

‚Ä¢ "Set speed 2-4-5"

‚Ä¢ "Set altitude 9 thousand 5 hundred"

‚Ä¢ "Set flight level 2-2-0" (use for altitudes above 10k feet)

‚Ä¢ "Lock vertical speed"

‚Ä¢ "Set vertical speed minus 2 thousand"

‚Ä¢ "Beacons on" / "Beacons off"

‚Ä¢ "Landing lights on" / "Landing lights off"

‚Ä¢ "Strobes on" / "Strobes off"

‚Ä¢ "My plane" / "My airplane" (deactivate autopilot)

‚Ä¢ "Set V1 1-3-0" / "Set VR 1-5-0" / "Set V2 1-6-0"

‚Ä¢ "Set Minimums 4 hundred"

---

## FAQ

- *How much does this cost?* Depends on your country. Roughly $4.99 for the core co-pilot app, $4.99 for the GPWS warning system, $4.99 for the Passenger Announcements, $4.99 for the voice commands (detecting a pattern?).
- *Is this part of Infinite Flight or a separate app?* It's a separate app, not affiliated with Infinite Flight, but it is an add-on to Infinite Flight.
- *What are the system requirements?* iOS 10 & the latest version of Infinite Flight
- *Do I need a headset for the voice commands?* This is strongly recommended - the problem is that otherwise the game sound, the ATC and the co-pilot callouts will be confused as possible voice commands. What may work also is use headphones only and the built-in mic.

**THANKS**

Huge thanks to this entire community for their amazing support encouraging me on in the [original monster thread](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/submitted-to-apple-for-review-in-flight-assistant-ios-app/74496/589) where I was asking for feedback & ideas. Thanks to Laura & Infinite Flight for providing an awesome game and an awesome API that makes apps like this one possible.

Also, thanks to @Cameron for his open-source API examples, those were super helpful.

Thanks to my beta testing team for their help! @jasonrosewell @Mark_Denton @Joe @Henrik @Tyler_Shelton @dush19 @Pilothodge80 JoshFly8 schyllberg Adrien nicolas (Sorry, the forum only lets me mention 10 users in a post üò¨)

Thanks to @Jan at [http://helpathand.nl](http://helpathand.nl) for helping to improve the audio quality!

Thanks to my wife for programming the "BANK ANGLE" warning. She still wants payment for that. üòú

Potato_pilot | 2016-12-13 06:29:56 UTC | #4

Yay! I'm looking forward to using this.

---

Kyle.Plane | 2016-12-13 06:34:55 UTC | #5

If I get an iTunes card for Christmas i will **definetly** be getting this first :)

EDIT: I have $6.50 in my account already, I'll be getting this for sure later!

---

Boodz_G | 2016-12-13 06:35:24 UTC | #6

I'm buying the app and all in-app purchases after I land ;-).

---

Aussie_Wombat | 2016-12-13 06:42:52 UTC | #7

I bought it - so cool!

---

Kyle.Plane | 2016-12-13 07:08:14 UTC | #8

I've got it! It's amazing, if I get a $5 gift voucher then I'll buy the GPWS or Voice commands :)

---

Kyle.Plane | 2016-12-13 07:11:35 UTC | #10

Just a question, is there a Vspeed calculator or a website with Vspeeds for some of the aircraft?

---

SWNelson | 2016-12-13 07:41:32 UTC | #11

Just got it.  I've been checking the AppStore a ton recently!  Thanks!

---

Divij | 2016-12-13 07:50:38 UTC | #12

I've been searching for a V Speed calculator for some time too with no luck. I think the best bet is to use the Aircraft POH for the particular aircraft you'd like to use. However If you do find a V Speed calculator, please do let me know :)

Just bought the app. It looks fantastic!

---

Boodz_G | 2016-12-13 07:55:41 UTC | #13

The voice commands don't work very well.

---

Aussie_Wombat | 2016-12-13 08:05:40 UTC | #14

Just one problem with the voice commands, when trying to raise the gear you have to say "gear down" and when you want the gear down you also have to say 'gear down'.  If this could be fixed in a future update that would be great!üôÇ

---

epaga | 2016-12-13 08:12:51 UTC | #15

Sorry to hear. Make sure you are

- using a headset
- have as quiet an environment as possible
- speak as clearly as you can

Can you let me know an example of a voice command that you're having issues with?

---

epaga | 2016-12-13 08:13:19 UTC | #16

"Gear up" should work as well. Internally it's the same command (Gear Toggle), so that's why either one works. :-)

---

Boodz_G | 2016-12-13 08:17:48 UTC | #17

I am using a headset.

I am in a quite environment.

I am.

Set speed 180 then he sets it to 1.

---

epaga | 2016-12-13 08:17:47 UTC | #18

OK, I know @Mark_Denton was having issues with heading and speed as well, but we thought that was just his wonderful accent. :-)

Would you mind recording a voice sample of yourself saying "set speed 1-8-0" with that headset and sending it to me? Maybe I can tweak the voice recognition engine to be more forgiving. ;-)

---

Potato_pilot | 2016-12-13 08:19:47 UTC | #19

Should we put feature requests we want for the app here, or do we PM you?

---

epaga | 2016-12-13 08:21:08 UTC | #20

Here, please! That way I have it all in one place.

---

GEA | 2016-12-13 08:23:47 UTC | #21

Nice news and nice work @epaga

---

Potato_pilot | 2016-12-13 08:24:29 UTC | #22

Cool. I've got one. I think on the Airbuses they've got a "Caution, obstacle" alarm. So say I was approaching some buildings on final approach, that alarm would go off. I know we don't have 3-D buildings yet, but maybe it could be added for heavy populated areas where there are a lot of houses and buildings.

Aussie_Wombat | 2016-12-13 08:49:27 UTC | #24

Ok, ThanksüòÄ I must say great job - it helps me a lot ( ecpecially the "let's watch our speed, Captain" ) ü§£

---

epaga | 2016-12-13 08:52:25 UTC | #25

That was actually the original inspiration for the entire app. I was fed up with getting overspeed violations and thought I'd build an app to warn myself when I was getting too fast. üòú

---

Aussie_Wombat | 2016-12-13 08:55:38 UTC | #26

This is not a problem with the mic or anything - I have this problem as well - it seems to be that it will only listen to the first number you say. I don't know, I'm just thankful for what we have got!üòé

DipperDolphin | 2016-12-13 10:06:12 UTC | #28

Great! Purchased. Could you make the IAPs a little cheaper, as they are pretty expensive (the same as the app).

---

MarioWHVGER | 2017-01-19 12:32:56 UTC | #29

Downloaded all 3. I'm excited! Exceed all my expectations! Works flawlessly. Absolute increase in the value of the game! The wait was worth it ! Successful work, respect,

Horny horny horny. !!!!!!!!!!!!!

---

epaga | 2016-12-13 10:08:16 UTC | #30

So far the few ones reporting voice command issues all have a non-American accent (except for @Mark_Denton of course, because what could be more American than Mark? üòú).

So I will be trying to improve the recognition for these cases.

---

DipperDolphin | 2016-12-13 10:10:40 UTC | #31

Just purchased both IAPs. For the commands, is it fine if I don't have a mic? If I just use the standard iPad microphone?

---

Aussie_Wombat | 2016-12-13 10:10:55 UTC | #32

Please do not get into the price discussion, he has stuck with the price and is keeping it that way.

---

epaga | 2016-12-13 10:12:40 UTC | #33

Nope, as stated both in the app and the FAQ you will need a headset for the recognition to work well. Infinite Flight itself is too loud and so even things like ATC or the voice callbacks will start getting recognized as commands.

---

SWNelson | 2016-12-13 10:12:54 UTC | #34

Is there a way to disable the 'Don't sink' callout?

---

DipperDolphin | 2016-12-13 10:13:16 UTC | #35

Just tap on it, then hit the switch to disable.

---

Aussie_Wombat | 2016-12-13 10:13:30 UTC | #36

The voice commands do work better with a external mic. However It still works with the built in mic.

---

DipperDolphin | 2016-12-13 10:14:19 UTC | #37

So if I wear standard headphone but use the mic is it okay?

I'm really happy this app does not require connection, and it is awesome work!

---

SWNelson | 2016-12-13 10:14:34 UTC | #38

Which one do you tap?  (If you were replying to me)

---

DipperDolphin | 2016-12-13 10:15:00 UTC | #39

Descent rate.

---

DipperDolphin | 2016-12-13 10:15:40 UTC | #40

@epaga On descent rate, what does steep approach bias mean?

Really glad I saved money for this. :D

---

Aussie_Wombat | 2016-12-13 10:17:50 UTC | #41

This is what I have been doing - I do not seem to have any problems (I am, though, investing in an external mic for iPad.)

---

SWNelson | 2016-12-13 10:17:55 UTC | #42

I presume if you have a steep approach, the warnings are less sensitive.

---

DipperDolphin | 2016-12-13 10:18:22 UTC | #43

Okay, great! Does it work well?

---

Aussie_Wombat | 2016-12-13 10:21:02 UTC | #44

Sorry I meant I will be investing in one (hopefully works well)

---

DipperDolphin | 2016-12-13 10:21:20 UTC | #45

I mean do the voice commands yet ;)

---

Aussie_Wombat | 2016-12-13 10:23:13 UTC | #46

Voice commands seem to work well, Since I have an Aussie accent the 'set speed 1-2-0' doesn't seem to work to well.üòâ

---

DipperDolphin | 2016-12-13 10:23:44 UTC | #47

What about a British accent? I don't really think I have an accent, but I will give it a spin later today.

---

Aussie_Wombat | 2016-12-13 10:25:02 UTC | #48

Everything should work pretty much as well as it should.

---

Leodhasach | 2016-12-13 10:27:28 UTC | #49

Good work there! I'll need to give it a try. I'll be interested to see if it can cope with my Highland brogue :-)

---

Zimnaan | 2016-12-13 10:30:29 UTC | #50

@epaga cool man! The IF community has become even better with inputs from Developers like you :-)

[quote="SWNelson, post:34, topic:84590, full:true"]

Is there a way to disable the 'Don't sink' callout?

[/quote]

Oops! Just realized I forgot to include that setting...sorry! I will include that for sure in a bugfix update.

[quote="SWNelson, post:42, topic:84590, full:true"]

I presume if you have a steep approach, the warnings are less sensitive.

[/quote]

That is correct. But that is for "SINK RATE" and "PULL UP" warnings, not the "DON'T SINK" warning, which comes when you start sinking again before initial takeoff is done.

*Note that if you keep hearing "DON'T SINK" during landing approach, then most likely you haven't got the newest Infinite Flight update yet, which is required.*

---

SWNelson | 2016-12-13 11:25:10 UTC | #59

I hear it during landing, but if you mean the C130 update, then I think I'm up to date...

---

epaga | 2016-12-13 11:26:22 UTC | #60

Strange...in that case, could you walk me through your flight? Which airport, which runway, to which altitude do you climb, how do you approach, etc?

---

SWNelson | 2016-12-13 11:27:31 UTC | #61

Just testing it out on short final in solo.  Don't think it's a problem your end, just the high power initially.  ''Tis just me I think - don't worry!

---

DipperDolphin | 2016-12-13 11:28:14 UTC | #62

Does it affect battery usage whilst playing a lot? Still need to give it a spin, however I am worried that its going to overheat my iPad, or use up a ton of battery.

---

SWNelson | 2016-12-13 11:28:49 UTC | #63

Not sure battery wise - but I was surprised my iPad didn't heat up.

---

epaga | 2016-12-13 11:29:31 UTC | #64

Not in my experience, however I've been using it more with higher end devices like the iPad Pro and an SE. You will want to shut down the IF-A app when you're done, otherwise it will continue to scan for IF and/or listen for your voice.

---

DipperDolphin | 2016-12-13 11:31:13 UTC | #65

Cool. I use an Air 2, so I'll give it a spin later today and see what happens!

---

epaga | 2016-12-13 11:37:44 UTC | #66

OK, so after trying out the voice samples @Boodz_G and @Emoji_Bird provided, I can say it is **not** looking like I will be able to improve the accuracy much for speakers with non-American accents. Boodz_G would say "set heading 1-2-0" and the recognition engine tells me he said "set heading gear"...no way to guess anything from that.

So that means if you're non-American and have a strong accent, you either will have to try to [impersonate an American accent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FFRoYhTJQQ&feature=youtu.be) or you make do with the more basic commands like "gear up", "landing lights on", "strobe lights on", etc., which tend to work better. Sorry I don't have better news!

---

SWNelson | 2016-12-13 11:40:23 UTC | #67

Well, not your fault.

---

DipperDolphin | 2016-12-13 11:49:06 UTC | #68

Couldn't you find voice samples, or record your own? Then have a language selector in the app. :D

---

epaga | 2016-12-13 12:01:46 UTC | #69

OK I added a "Coming Next Update" section to the main post up top in case you're wondering what will be included in the next update.

---

**COMING WITH NEXT UPDATE**

- Spoiler change voice command
- Spoiler change confirmation callout
- Speed warning less often when around 250 kts
- No taxi speed warnings after landing
- Enable/Disable Mode 3 GPWS warnings ("DON'T SINK")

---

Joshua_Fleming | 2016-12-13 12:14:18 UTC | #70

Looks very cool , i might buy it to show my support and just to try it out as it looks really cool. @epaga quick question if i don't have a headset will it still work with the voice commands , as if i buy it i am going to buy the full thing !

---

epaga | 2016-12-13 12:18:27 UTC | #71

Just added an FAQ since this question is coming up often

- *Do I need a headset for the voice commands?* This is strongly recommended - the problem is that otherwise the game sound, the ATC and the co-pilot callouts will be confused as possible voice commands. What may work also is use headphones only and the built-in mic.

---

George | 2016-12-13 12:18:53 UTC | #72

Great Job @epaga ! Looks legit! I'm pretty sure this app will make Infinite Flight more realistic! :D

---

*Sadly I'm not an iOS user T^T*

Any plans to make this app available for Android users?

---

epaga | 2016-12-13 12:19:47 UTC | #73

See the FAQ.

- *Will there be an Android version?* Not at the start. No promises for afterward, but I know some of you [REALLY](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/coming-soon-in-flight-assistant-ios-app-example-video-included/74496/412?u=epaga) want one.

---

Lewis_Birdie_Avery | 2016-12-13 13:11:08 UTC | #75

Had to download this over lunch just to see what it was it was like, and although I need to work on the commands (possibly speaking to fast)? Its fantastic and I can‚Äôt wait to use it tonight on a proper flight. Already looking forward to the update and for everybody saying it should be free etc etc. I‚Äôve just spent ¬£8 on it and from my brief play about can recommend it 100%. If you want realism, this is the way forward.

is there anyway to "save" settings for various aircraft ? Instead of having to put in the speeds for each aircraft, even tho some have similar.

Great idea that I've had before. Bookmarked this as an idea for a future improvement.

Any way to add a '5' callout for Airbuses?  I've been using your app for the past hour or so.  It's awesome!

Any reports on battery usage? Looking forward to giving it a spin on the bus home!

No noticeable difference.  Possibly a bit more usage but certainly not much.

Eager to buy this great looking app but just wondering whether you know of any latency issues with older iPads ü§î I‚Äôm using a 3rd generation iPad and normally shut down all other apps in order for IF to work optimally. If anyone else is using this app with a 3rd generation iPad I‚Äôd like to hear your thoughts . . .

Well, that was my Christmas money, great job!

This was fantastic. I need to get use to the voice commands but this was a fantastic experience flying with a copilot. Great job on this app

If you anunciate your words and don't slur them, the voice commands work perfectly.

I have just purchased the app and regarding the callouts is there anyway to increase the volume of them as I can barely hear them

---

epaga | 2016-12-13 15:48:25 UTC | #94

The problem I've found is less the volume of the callouts and more the (nice &) loud volume of Infinite Flight. So what I've done is reduced the Infinite Flight volume a tad in the settings THERE, and then there's a bit of a better mix with In-Flight Assistant.

Why is it IOS 10 only

Why is it IOS 10 only

[/quote]

Because the latest & greatest development environment that Apple offers is Xcode 8 and only supports iOS 10. Didn't feel like working with old tools just to support outdated iOS versions. Sorry. My son is in the same boat, his iPod touch doesn't  support iOS 10 and he was hoping to use my app... üò≠

Chatta290 | 2016-12-13 15:51:25 UTC | #97

I will try that but if not I think I will get a refund for, Apple as it's useless to me, Great app but maybe find a way to increase the volume, if there is a possibility of this I don't mind keeping it and waiting for a update in the near future, thanks

@epaga, congratulations on your app and on behalf of the community I would like to thank you for putting in the work into developing this amazing app, It's people like you who make IF so special and unique on the mobile app store and we appreciate your contributions.

Sounds like @jasonrosewell has a new future guest for IF Podcast. Would love to hear your inspiration behind this app and your development story and what vision you have for it for the future :)

DipperDolphin | 2016-12-13 16:59:07 UTC | #101

I'll be refunding voice commands, as it does not work great for me, but I'll keep the rest of the app as I do like it.
