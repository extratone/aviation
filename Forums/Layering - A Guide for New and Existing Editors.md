# [Layering - A Guide for New and Existing Editors](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/layering-a-guide-for-new-and-existing-editors/755753)

Why am I doing this?

A frequently asked question in the discord is about how to make your airport better; how to make it stand out. Not often is the case where utilising different facades by themselves will help an airport's realism and structure be maximised to the highest possible extent. This guide is aimed at helping these queries, and hopefully, teaching more about the use of layering - and how much it can turn a building from zero to hero without compromising the motivation of editors, and the doubt that so many face about their own editing skills.

How will the guide be structured?

In order to make it as easy as possible to find your way around the guide, I'll be splitting it into three sections:

- **Section 1** - This section will cover the relevant skills needed to be able to successfully complete a build whilst utilising layering; as much as I'd like to say it's an easy thing to get your head around, there are some necessary details and points you must take into consideration before starting your build. Section 1 will also entail a small extra part about how to distribute layered airports. It's important that you differentiate between buildings which should be layered, could be layered, and might be layered.
- **Section 2** - This will be a small video section. A video, by @Ecoops123 of him creating LIMC tower. It should hopefully help editors understand a different point of view of layering, and help them understand how different towers can be compared to terminals/other buildings.
- **Section 2a** - A small section on the importance of roof types. I'll cover some important facts that Reviewers and Moderators want known - so that when it comes to ORs/PRs, it's not just looks that stand out, it's performance and accuracy too.
- **Section 3** - The final section will be where we summarise what we've learnt, and will also include some very impressive examples by some of the more experienced editors for which this guide is aimed at helping new (and existing) editors become.

---

## Section 1

Layering can have many complexities added to the sides. You will often find yourself (Without sufficient knowledge) including many bugs and oddities in your build, and this can lead to buildings looking off, or out of place as a whole.

I'll be splitting section one into 2 parts here - The first part will be a run-through of a step-by-step guide on how to create a layered building, and I'll also be including some do's and don'ts too so it's clear on what you're doing. The second part is a detailed analysis of a slightly larger building. This part will also include some do's and don'ts but will be more focused on helping editors understand why things are in certain places.

### Part 1:

The aim of this part is to hopefully provide an easy way to get a good result, from fairly easy uses of layering. Although there are different ways in which you can layer, this in my opinion is one of the most rewarding. So - What are we making?

KPDX fire station. You can have so much creativity when it comes to things like this, so I think this makes for one of the best examples.

Because there are a lot of pictures, I'll be hiding this tutorial under a drop-down.

[details="Tutorial"]

---

1. The first and pretty simple part of approaching something like this is looking at its outline. You need to establish whether using just one base layer is your best bet or, using different bases. For the sake of this tutorial, I'll be using a single base.

![]()

---

2. As this is our base, and the building is made out of brick, we're going to change the facade to brick.

---

3. An important thing to note is that layering isn't always just putting things on top of each other to build outwards; often it means building inwards too, and when looking at a fire station such as this, you'll see why:

![]()

In order to create the shutters, we need to make indents in the building. A shape along the lines of this should do.

---

4. Then, we're going to stick a building in that gap, then set the facade as 'Hangar 05, section 2' - please also bear in mind that you'll need to stick a node in the middle to make the whole facade white.

![]()

---

5. Next, duplicate the building below and then auto-altitude it. This part is for the window and will make or break the build. Not really much you can get wrong here, so this should be quite straightforward.

![]()

---

6. I've kind of skipped a bit ahead here, so I'll split it into colours.

Red - This is from the original building that was there; I've split it into 4 parts, and this is to make the dividers between the windows. To do this, simply duplicate the original building, then move across and snap accordingly.

Amber - The original base. Nothing really to note here except a closer look at how the base has been modified to fit the door in.

Blue - This is the original building, and again, nothing to note except to ensure that this is snapped to the base.

Green - This is the glass. The facades of these can be adjusted accordingly depending on location and personal preference, but for this build, I feel these facades work best.

One other thing to note that is not included in this picture - duplicate the lower building and then change the height as appropriate to create the upper part of the shutter. It's also worth getting the correct altitude on this too.

![]()

---

7. To do this process en-mass, simply replicate the structure on the base like shown in part 3, then add to a group the parts of the shutter then copy and paste accordingly.

---

8. As the build comes to an end, this is where you start to look for realism and how it is IRL. I've decided to add these grey poles in utilising the Vienna Terminal facade. Using things like this too can also help hide messy/glitchy edges which make the build look odd.

![]()

![]()

---

9. Lastly, we need to get the blue roof in. Unfortunately, as we only have white and grey in the facade list for roofs - we'll need to be creative and utilise the logistics centre facade to at least get some blue in. You'll find that this helps tremendously when looking at it from afar.

Please note that when you come to much larger buildings - the level of detail that you see here can be hard to replicate on a much larger scale and that different styles of building can be used to achieve a good result.

---

Part 2:

![]()

As you can see, there are numbers 1-8 which I'll go through.

1. At the forefront of the building, you'll need something which will stand out. Here I've used 'Hotel 01, Face 5' to create the door effect that gives a creative aurora, and I've found it a very clever way to utilise small parts of facades without making them considered as a cutoff. Another thing is its depth in the building. You want something like a door to be set in the building as it gives depth and a sense of realism. (Realism is really going to become a recurring theme whenever you decide to use Layering.)
2. Throughout the right-hand side of the build, you'll see these grey pole-like structures. Not only do these again, increase the depth and overall feel of the build, but when used in real life, the 'Vienna Terminal' facade can really come in handy when trying to replicate metal/steel structures which aren't corrugated metal plates. It's also important to have these going both laterally and vertically, as, without them, the whole build will feel as one, and not separated to the maximum extent; one of the key ideas you should bare in mind whilst doing this is that in order to layer properly, you need to separate a huge flat facade with structures that stick out. Evidence of this in real life can be found almost anywhere - look at your house, look at almost any terminal at any international airport. Trust me, you'll find it.
3. Again utilising the 'Hotel 01' facade, you can use 'Face 4' for windows that aren't vertically and laterally separated. What it means, is that you can use this facade to create circular/rounded structures and make them look as good as possible without trying to extend the limits of the editor. Something I see quite often is people trying to go beyond the bounds of what actually is possible. Please, bear in mind that after all, it is a game and not all the time can we replicate structures without compromising the integrity of a build. However, more to the point - The building here has been snapped to the plain white one behind, and in the evenest way too. It's important that you include symmetry in your builds, as it'll help it look more believable, and help anybody who views it in the simulator to really get a feel for what it looks like in real life.
4. For the 4 windows which have been copied and pasted in the middle of the build - These are essential to fill up blank space. Remember, provided it's there, always add it. Even with more difficult tasks which include a lot more work, it's always worth adding something which increases the realism and depth of an airport. There's also another big thing you should bear in mind too, which is that the symmetry of the windows is imperative to a. Passing the OR, and b. Helping your build to become something memorable and as close to the real thing as possible. Another thing also worth noting, and said very well by @Rhys_V is that "*One thing to note about using windows that are just "stuck" onto buildings is that unless they specifically stick out IRL, they should be moved as close as possible to the facade without any facade glitching*" You'll see in the picture here that the windows stick out, but this is only because they do so IRL.
5. Moving on here to the actual fire station, the doors here are made up of 3 individual buildings. I've done this so that it's far easier to create separation between facades and have the freedom to create my 'own' facade. If we ignore the fire station facade for now, you'll see the top and bottom ones - The top one here is the most important, as the facade itself (Hangar 01, 'concrete wall without windows') includes a small grey strip across the bottom, which helps the white separate itself from the window facade of the fire station. Again, this is a really important idea when you want to separate things laterally without making them look mashed together.
6. This is tied in with the last point, but the fire station facade here is imperative to making the fire station, look like a fire station! It's very difficult to recreate structures with these sorts of functions without using the facades you've been given to do so. I actually got the idea for this from a fellow community member, so again, another reason to ask around. It's really helpful.
7. Another good example of using the grey 'Vienna Terminal' facade to help separate vertically and laterally, and the darks from the whites. When you use this, it allows the building to be seen from quite a distance, and when seen up close, allows whoever is looking at it to gain a sense of feel and depth to something which isn't even the most important building in the airport. Key idea no.2 - Buildings that are a part of the airport don't always need a lot of attention. Making these buildings as realistic as possible will really help your builds stand out from others out there. There is, however, an extreme to this - don't go around adding every single building you can find on satellite imagery, as it must always have a use, and be within airport boundaries.
8. Last but not least, the shape of this build is what helps it stand out amongst others. It's not a square/rectangular building. The 'curve' if you will, helps the building project inwards. What I mean by this will help with a simple analogy. A flat building with one singular facade will project outwards, as there's nothing layered on top of it, nor is there anything in the main building projecting within the square structure. It's like making a perfect circle with a piece of string, then using a pencil to prod at it and make it change shape. My point is when a building has parts going inwards and outwards, its depth and overall looks help it to be as close as possible to IRL, and give a creative sense of irregularity to your build too.

As much as we'd all want to layer almost every single aspect of our airports - it's just simply not doable. As I'm sure editors who are experienced with layering will agree, layering takes time, and when you try to rush it or attempt to layer every single aspect of your airport, it can be quite de-motivating, as often you'll find yourself bouncing from place to place, and not doing the thing you intended to do. The three screenshots below are a rough guide on what places should, could, and might be worth layering in your airport. The size of the airport will increase from each screenshot.

Green = Layering critical.

Amber = Layering beneficial but determine whether needed or not.

Red = Not necessarily worth layering.

This is KPDX, Portland. It has a main passenger concourse, a cargo terminal area, and a military outpost. Labelled 1-9 are the areas that should, could, and might be worth layering.

1. Fire station - This is highly worth layering, as I've found in the past that the level of detail you can get out of even just the most basic fire station can be very high. It's also important that you get some detail in this far corner of the airport too.
2. Definitely not worth layering here. It's somewhere that can be easily covered by utilising the correct facade. This can become a common theme when you look at ramp areas which won't get a lot of attention when the airport is finally released.
3. As it's a place which will get used a fair amount, I'd say the cargo terminal is worth layering. Even to a simple extent - layering somewhere like this can/will add a lot of character to an industry/part of the game that is often overlooked.
4. Another general ramp area; I would advise against layering here, although if you feel like it's a place which would get used a lot, It could be a useful area to layer in.
5. Only recently was the military part of the game improved, so layering here will likely be beneficial to the character and density of the airport - and as the game starts to get more military attention, layering here will definitely reap a ton of rewards visually for any pilot who flies military.
6. Absolutely worth layering here. As it's the main passenger concourse, this is the core of the airport and not layering here will be an incorrect judgement of this part of the airports' usefulness.
7. Car parks; very easy to just utilise the car park facade and not turn the game into a 'car parking simulator'
8. For me this was a go-to for layering - it's the front of the airport and deserves some attention. As a pilot, you'll definitely appreciate the eye for realism when spawning in on this side of the airport.
9. A general ramp area again, but this could be somewhere worth layering. It's likely going to be a place where you'll get a lot of traffic, and as a pilot waiting in a departure line of 10+, appreciating the layering here is definitely something I'd enjoy doing.

This is EGLF, Farnborough. As a private airport, this is a place which will end up getting a lot of attention due to the upcoming challenger 350, so it's imperative that you utilise layering in the correct places; and where pilots will appreciate it. Labels 1-7.

1. This is a maintenance facility and will likely go unused when released. And as mentioned in KPDX, it's easy to utilise the right facades here to create something good.
2. A place absolutely worth layering - it will get high traffic volumes, and is an essential part of the airports' character.
3. Again, this part of the airport is absolutely essential to its character ingame. The hangars at Farnborough IRL are a unique part of the airports' identity and fundamental to the visuals which pilots will be getting.
4. This should really be amber, but I'd say that as this is somewhere that will be getting a lot of traffic, it's worth adding something aesthetically pleasing here.
5. I would advise against layering somewhere here. IRL it's a highly unused part of the airport, and therefore when released, you can get the idea that it'll also be unused too.
6. As part of the airshow at Farnborough, somewhere like this is a good place to consider using layering. When the airshow comes around you might want to re-enact your own airshow, so getting good visuals here is a must.
7. Again, an essential part of the airports' uniqueness and also somewhere which will get a fair amount of traffic.

EISG, Sligo. This is a very small airport but this shows how even the smallest airports can receive layering to help it stand out amongst others. Labelled 1-3 (Left to right)

1. General hangar area. This will vary from airport to airport, a hangar area can be essential or could be quite separated from the areas which will get used - it's up to you to determine this. It's also important to note that if an airport this size is your first, decide whether getting to know the editor before you start playing around with it first is your best bet.
2. This is the essential part of the airport; especially poignant if you look at how small the airport is too. It's likely that when released, this part will be the keystone of the airport.
3. Again, not an essential part but whether or not you choose to layer things like this on an airport this size, is up to you.

If the point hasn't already been made - A very important thing to keep in mind is that if you're trying to layer on your very first airport - don't go overboard. After all, reviewers are asking for you to nail the fundamentals, then, and only then, to start experimenting with different styles/techniques of layering/editing.

Section 2

Videos by @Ecoops123

The videos consist of him making LIMC tower. The video is split into 2 parts - part 1 - the base layer, and part 2 - the actual tower itself.

I will provide timestamps with a relevant explanation of what's going on, as to help any new/current editors.

[details="Part 1"]

[https://youtu.be/d60WitTMuEw](https://youtu.be/d60WitTMuEw)

Timestamps:

**0:15** - Creating the base. This is fundamental to the structure of the build and will play a huge part in determining how the rest of the build turns out. You could also, make another point about building rectangularity - Sometimes common feedback in ORs/PRs can be that buildings are wonky, or they're not properly aligned with scenery.

**0:30** Changing the height, and facades. This will help in layering each individual floor of the tower. For reference, the average 'Moritz' is around 1.75m

**1:08** Nothing special, but just getting on about the whole layering concept - Adding things on top of each other to build outwards/upwards.

**1:50** The buildings here are a very good example of how you can build around corners and get rid of the square/rectangle shapes you'll see very often.

**1:56** Again, another important thing to note - build inwards and outwards. It helps add so much depth to your build and will increase viewing pleasure.

**2:19** Keeping a consistent facade across all aspects of the build. < keep in mind.

**2:54** Another key concept about layering - set up the outside bits, then layer up in the middle accordingly. In this example, it's layering up floor levels.

**3:45** Remember, nothing is set in stone. Adjusting heights so long as it's realistic is absolutely fine - but make sure, and as done in the video - you auto-altitude all levels and try to reduce any sort of clipping.

**4:00** Capping it off with a roof - nothing else to note really.

That's all for part 1 - see part 2 for more.

[/details]

[details="Part 2"]

[https://youtu.be/GNWvl_QCnTI](https://youtu.be/GNWvl_QCnTI)

This being the slightly longer video, I'll still be providing timestamps but only at key points.

Timestamps:

**0:51** This is a very clever use of models to help make circular shapes. Especially when making towers, this is an easy way to do so.

**2:04** Again, use models to make perfectly square/rectangular shapes. This is essential when making buildings with precise measurements.

**3:27** Playing about with facades is a really good idea, especially when you want to find out which facades work best with others.

**4:10** When stacking things, ensure 2 things: 1. - That the heights are correct, and 2. - that whatever you're stacking is snapped to what is below; essential if you don't want buildings to overlap.

**6:28** If you flick back a few seconds, you'll see a really good example of the ideas listed at **4:10** - Snapping and heights.

**7:33** Another good example of using models to trace circular shapes.

**9:33** More good uses of the fuel tank to make circular shapes. This time though, the size of each circle has changed slightly, so bear in mind that although you won't be snapping anything, getting the heights right is still an important idea.

**11:13** Good overview of what Ethan was doing. The buildings get smaller every time, and by the same amount too. He simply adjusted the scale of the fuel tank every time by the same amount to get this effect.

**13:16** Finished product of what is above ^^.

**14:39** Good view of the importance of building inwards/outwards. It helps your building stand out so much and can help add a sloped feeling without the use of curves.

**15:47** Making towers like this can be very rewarding. It offers another way to make towers without the use of models - different opportunities to do very different things. By doing this, you're not conformed to sticking with the basic tower shape.

**16:42** More use of models to create circular shapes.

**18:19** If you look at the outline of the build, Ethan has essentially copied what's gone on below - just in a smaller way.

**19:37** In terms of actually making the tower look like a tower, using the model to get the antennae is a creative way

**20:48** Last timestamp - this shows the pretty much complete version of the tower - Feel free to take a good look at the techniques he's used and how they've turned out.

[/details]

Section 2a

Roof types can also play a large part in layering too. Not only does it allow you to change the colour of a roof, but it lets you have more freedom when trying to improve performance, and trying to build vertically too. I'll split this small section into 3 categories so you can read only the things you need to.

---

**Performance:**

EDDB is a good example of limiting the number of roofs for performance. Since it's an already large airport, @Ramzi_Khairan has decided to compromise realism and accuracy for performance. This is a perfectly valid idea when considering how large airports are. If it doesn't need to be rendered, then either a. don't add it, or b. set the roof type to none. This will allow only the sides of buildings to be visible/rendered and will help performance a bunch.

![]()

I've used three arrows to represent the places where he's tried to compromise looks for performance. The white squares on the roof are a good example of what you can do without curved roofs or a ridiculous amount of buildings/nodes. Secondly, the middle arrow is nothing special, but he's used only one roof, and got it very rectangular too - so to an extent, trying to get the best looks possible out of the materials available.

Lastly, the arrow on the left is representative of the detail you can have, even whilst making it as simplistic as can be.

[details="EDDB IRL for comparison."]

![]()

[/details]

---

**Building Vertically:**

For this example, we'll turn to our good friend @Ecoops123 We'll use his example of LIMC tower to explain how roof types play a big part in looking up! *looking up?* Yes - you heard me. When you set the roof type to none, you're able to see right through the building. Remember, when getting your heights right, also make sure to get your roofs right too. (The parts that are circled should have roof type set to none)

![]()

As this example has a high building count - it would make sense for the buildings which don't need a roof i.e the offices, to not have one. It'll save a bunch performance-wise on an already challenging render. I would also suggest that having roofs that go outwards, it helps add a somewhat circular feature to the build - and creates a certain level of eye candy for any pilots looking up at it.

---

**Accuracy/Realism:**

Although this may look like a fairly simple example, I can promise you it isn't. This building at KJFK has many layers to an already complex terminal - and performance aside, this is likely the most perfect example I could find. It allows for so much depth without overcomplicating/compromising a building's looks by adding too much. Credit goes to @Siddhansh for this one.

![]()

I'll go through each arrow one by one to explain what's going on:

The 2 arrows furthest away arrow are a good example of how you can sink things into other buildings - It, a. makes the building more realistic, and b. adds a weird up-and-down effect, as to someone who's viewing it from the side/above it's not just one flat building.

The arrow below those two helps us think about how you can create ledges differently. He hasn't just used the standard ledge that you get on every building but has instead decided to create his one width, and own height here so that as a viewer, you can get a really good idea of the separation going on.

The 3 closest arrows also help us think about how from the ramp, you can build up to the back. What it does, is create a curved-like feeling and can really make a pilot think about two things. a. the effort and thought that has gone into making the building, and b. generally, appreciate its realism and accuracy.

---

One last thing - some wise words from Ethan.

"*ensure the most layers possible have roof types set to none, and that both floors and roofs are affected, meaning it should be made sure to avoid setting roof types to those with visible undersides or roofs.*"

This is key for any airport passing OR/PR, so ensure this is done.

Section 3

Summarising everything; what have we learnt?

Section 1: We've learnt that the concept of layering is many parts combined into one - not in any way shape or form is layering something that can be just inserted and left alone; It's good to play about with different ideas, and that by doing so, you get the very best end product possible. It's also important that you don't change midway through, as with every large project, you must stick to what you set out to do to be successful.

Furthermore, we've learnt that investing your time into only a single part of an airport at a time is your best bet - Don't go jumping from place to place! This also leads us to the theme of motivation. Remember, by jumping from place to place you’re ignoring the things that maybe you're not so good at, and if you ignore those parts you'll never get better at those certain things, or to a certain extent, even get things done. Note that eating away at something even in small pieces will give you the best chance at churning out the best possible result - A key idea for large airports especially.

Section 2: With thanks to Ethan, we've learnt how to make a tower, whilst using models to create perfect circles, and how to successfully stack things on top of each other - something that is really important when building vertically. He is also another very good example of somebody who plays about with their build before deciding on a final product.

Sendoff:

Thank you very much for reading, and I hope that you can relate this guide to any of the airports you're working on currently/going to work on in the future.

I'd also just like to say a huge thank you to @Rhys_V and @Ecoops123 for their priceless help, and for having to put up with me for 2 weeks :)
