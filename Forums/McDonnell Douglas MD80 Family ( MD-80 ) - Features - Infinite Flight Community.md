The MD-88 was first ordered and delivered to Delta Airlines in 1987 a MD-82. The MD-88 has a max cruising speed at 574 MPH (498.792 Kt).

Yes it is.

---

Boeing707 | 2015-10-03 22:32:44 UTC | #5

It's the MD-80 family, not MD-88 family :).

Otherwise, terrific idea! Flown on quite a few DL MD-88s and would love to get my hands on those Pratts instead of the RRs for the 717s.

Love the long cigar engines on the aircraft, and the DL livery suits it perfectly!

Love the biliography too

Actually you are allowed 1 picture in a feature request. "No more than 1 picture per feature request (preferably in the initial post)" as said here:

[About the Features category](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/about-the-features-category/200?u=tecnam2ta)

But besides that, bumping this back up because I'd love to see this family of aircraft in IF. We need more rear mounted engine planes.

---

Furtive_masstwofourf | 2016-01-28 02:25:32 UTC | #7

This was before they changed that ;)

---

Tecnam2TA | 2016-01-28 02:27:45 UTC | #8

Oh I thought it was always like that. Oh sorry Mason:)

---

Tecnam2TA | 2016-02-12 15:58:05 UTC | #9

I love the MD-80 Family and would love to fly them in IF.

---

NatIsrael972 | 2016-02-12 15:59:06 UTC | #10

Mad Dogs, why not? :D

---

Delta757 | 2016-02-12 16:30:54 UTC | #11

Flying on the MD-88 is actually pretty comfortable, I have flown from BWI-ATL a few times in them. The Wifi and upgraded interiors make for a enjoyable ride, especially toward the front. Delta had upgraded the interiors on them not too long ago and it was much newer and nicer than the MD-90 and 757's I have flown on so far. Love the Md-88!

---

Furtive_masstwofourf | 2016-02-12 17:06:46 UTC | #12

Mad dog!! Love this aircraft, the first airplane I ever went on.

---

Ryan_Vince | 2016-02-12 18:01:16 UTC | #13

I'm sure the MD-80 will happen at some point :)

---

jdawgbmw | 2016-02-14 02:00:50 UTC | #14

Don't forget that the 717 is related to the family

---

emil | 2016-11-10 20:44:27 UTC | #15

Yes please!!! We need this! I love the MD-80s

---

marvin_buxton | 2016-11-10 21:35:45 UTC | #16

Alaska had some and they were great "untill flight 261" but would be great in IF

---

brunocr98 | 2016-11-11 00:16:42 UTC | #17

I support the MD-80 family!

---

DeltaCRJ-900 | 2016-11-13 01:46:26 UTC | #18

We need this! (In my opinion)

---

787Boy | 2016-11-20 13:16:23 UTC | #19

I'm back after months and months of no activity! The md-88 is becoming slowly outdated though. The chances of the devs creating this is getting slimmer and slimmer.

---

Tombomb777 | 2016-11-20 13:37:32 UTC | #20

Would love to see mad dogs in the game

---

sam_haase | 2016-11-22 13:57:03 UTC | #21

love that idea. Livery's id love to see are delta, Reno air, american, and northwest orient.

---

Ninetales | 2016-11-22 13:59:40 UTC | #22

Would love to fly it.

---

Md11 | 2016-12-17 14:56:14 UTC | #23

This is what i was looking for.

Great aircraft and has a beautiful look, i think they should add this. Thereare lots of liveries to put in this aircraft. Would be amazing to fly this

---

PlaneCrazy | 2016-12-17 14:57:06 UTC | #24

It's amazing that this only has 20 likes!

---

Md11 | 2016-12-17 15:14:46 UTC | #25

Me too they are really nice aircrafts

---

Kyle.r24 | 2017-06-19 23:37:08 UTC | #26

Love the mad dogs, this has my vote!

---

Gavin_Hertel | 2017-06-20 06:09:54 UTC | #27

Infinite Flight would be complete if they add the mad dogs. üòçüòç

---

Aussie_Cockatoo | 2017-06-20 06:38:46 UTC | #28

If American Airlines adds the new livery to one of these, I will vote for this!

---

Kevin | 2017-06-20 07:07:47 UTC | #29

They won't be. The poor things (maddogs)are getting retired faster then ever.

---

Aussie_Cockatoo | 2017-06-20 07:41:24 UTC | #30

That is sad. It is always sad to see a McDonnell Douglas go. üòî

---

CJLAviation | 2017-06-26 03:05:52 UTC | #31

There is something about this aircraft that I just **LOVE**! It look so sharp, and mean...at least to me! Hope it is eventually added! :)

---

GhostDaGhost | 2017-07-14 02:01:29 UTC | #32

Would love to see this!

---

Will_Haxton | 2017-07-14 02:04:39 UTC | #33

Hopefully if this gets added to the game then the newest member of the family will get a rework (717) üòâ

---

Reedgreat | 2017-07-14 02:05:38 UTC | #34

Such a beautiful aircraft with a unique history.  Would love to see it.

[spoiler]don't worry, I'm not one of those talkers.  I actually voted :)[/spoiler]

---

Drew33950 | 2017-07-14 02:55:08 UTC | #35

One of my favorite aircrafts, would love to see it added.

---

Sam_S | 2017-07-14 03:08:09 UTC | #36

My favorite aircraft of all time! I've ridden on them multiple times. Can you imagine those bucket reversers on the JT8Ds in IF? Yes please!

---

Darth_Sidious | 2017-07-14 10:11:14 UTC | #37

It looks exactly like the 717-200 we already have in the game...?

---

Deaf | 2017-07-14 10:33:35 UTC | #38

Yeah Boeing 717 was supposed to be MD-95, but Boeing renamed it after merging with McDonnell Douglas.

---

ftube | 2017-07-15 20:17:53 UTC | #39

They were great after that to since it was Alaska Airlines' maintanence fault for the crash

---

HEYEY | 2017-08-03 16:37:58 UTC | #40

Oh my god I would love this

---

HEYEY | 2017-09-02 12:53:18 UTC | #41

gonna bump this again

---

ftube | 2017-09-02 13:11:27 UTC | #42

I would definitely fly this in global in the SAS livery.

---

Nycjacob | 2017-09-07 19:13:04 UTC | #43

this plane would be awesome for global

---

HEYEY | 2017-09-11 16:56:08 UTC | #44

I would fly this around Indonesia allll the time in the Lion Air or Airfast liveries (assuming they add it)

---

LewisG0801 | 2017-09-11 17:23:32 UTC | #45

Let's be honest who doesn't want this ;)

---

Nycjacob | 2017-10-18 12:08:05 UTC | #46

this is the real aviator's airplane, I feel like Laura and the team mostly listens to some of the "main stream" airplanes this plane would be amazing!

---

Bfinley1255 | 2017-10-18 12:28:59 UTC | #47

‚ÄúMainstream‚Äù man, I hear that word used a lot since 2016. What, exactly, makes the MD-series non-mainstream? They built nearly 1200 airframes and are widely used to this day.

---

RobertM | 2017-10-18 12:41:36 UTC | #48

why do the engines look like they are tilted up?

---

SWNelson | 2017-10-18 12:44:17 UTC | #49

I think they always look like that - I‚Äôm guessing it helps the power direction considering it‚Äôs a rear engine plane.

---

Nycjacob | 2017-10-18 14:22:02 UTC | #50

Unfortunately, most people hate the Md-80 which sucks because it's such a great plane, most of the people who play infinite flight or comment on Instagram only so certain planes Ex: 737, 747, a320

---

Bfinley1255 | 2017-10-18 14:40:32 UTC | #51

Okay, I can see what you mean.

---

Reedgreat | 2017-12-12 18:43:17 UTC | #52

I am going to give this request a small forum poke.  Beautiful aircraft, it would fit perfectly in IF! :)

---

Ironman_Ballets | 2017-12-12 19:46:43 UTC | #53

love to see this added looking forward to the retro American livery

---

Nycjacob | 2018-01-22 06:27:05 UTC | #54

We really need the mad dog ‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è

---

Delta350 | 2018-02-04 03:54:00 UTC | #55

WHAT: MD-80 Series, a rear-mounted, twin-engined, short-haul airliner introduced in the 80‚Äôs

WHY: This is a very unique aircraft that would add more diversity in IF. Also, this ‚ÄúMad Dog‚Äù is used on many short haul/domestic flights. I grew up flying on many of these via Delta Airlines, so it has a special place in my heart.

Let me know below on what you think. Should this aircraft be added or not?

Happy Landings!

Cbro4 | 2018-02-04 04:04:43 UTC | #56

I see these a lot at KCVG. Would LOVE to have this in IF with the CRJs.

---

Boeing797 | 2018-02-06 22:15:42 UTC | #57

They may still add it even though it is old, they added the MD-11 and It's even older than the MD-80 and the only operators that still use it are cargo.

---

Animalcraft_Ftw | 2018-02-12 16:01:44 UTC | #58

This would be nice to have instead of using just the 717

---

DeltaMD88Fan | 2018-02-12 19:08:38 UTC | #59

Heck yess!!!!! I want this after the CRJ!!!

## Just imagine how it would look in IF...

---

Michael_McMurray | 2018-02-12 22:43:28 UTC | #61

Always the first plane that pops in my head when we are asked what plane we would like to see next.

---

KarlMcDonkey | 2018-02-13 01:58:56 UTC | #62

Id love to see the MD-80 SERIES along with the the crj 900/1000. I'm all about the rear engines!

---

HEYEY | 2018-05-30 13:51:34 UTC | #63

I would take this over an A330/A340 rework tbh

---

Delta319 | 2018-05-30 14:28:44 UTC | #64

Gotta vote for this.

One of my fave short-haul aircraft

---

Logan_Lee | 2018-05-30 14:30:13 UTC | #65

The MD-80 Family is one of the planes i would love to see on IF as well as the a350 family, a320 neo and a321 neo

---

DeltaMD88Fan | 2018-05-31 17:13:34 UTC | #66

If you intellectuals read my username you can decide if i voted for this or not XD

---

NordicFlyer | 2018-05-31 17:55:52 UTC | #67

I‚Äôll vote for this. The MD-80 would be an awesome classic airliner to have in the sim.

---

Hockeyman_02 | 2018-06-24 02:11:19 UTC | #68

You‚Äôve got your 56 vote! I think that the Maddog family would be absolutely great as an addition especially with the quality of the new aircraft!

---

JT_Playz | 2018-06-24 22:17:07 UTC | #69

I am voting for this! I always fly the Madog every time I go somewhere!

---

Turboprop400 | 2018-06-25 05:29:24 UTC | #70

I hope this plane gets added before almost all airlines retire it from service in favor of newer planes

---

Pinecone | 2018-07-23 13:00:02 UTC | #71

Mad dogs FTW! One of my favorite planes üëå

---

Drew33950 | 2018-07-23 13:08:42 UTC | #73

thats a dc9 not an md80

---

Pinecone | 2018-07-23 13:11:02 UTC | #74

They are pretty much the same...

---

Delta319 | 2018-07-23 13:12:32 UTC | #75

Not really.. the DC-9 is smaller

---

Pinecone | 2018-07-23 13:13:42 UTC | #76

A YouTuber named Bellcc has a video of the differences between the DC9, MD80, and 717.

---

KingWings | 2018-07-23 13:15:29 UTC | #77

I know guys, I used it as a *display*, I wasn't able to find an MD-80

---

Pinecone | 2018-07-23 13:16:24 UTC | #78

It‚Äôs all good dude üòÉ

---

Nycjacob | 2018-08-03 06:57:45 UTC | #79

work house of some major US airlines must need!

---

Jeremy_H | 2018-08-03 09:26:00 UTC | #80

I‚Äôd like to see the MD-88/MD-90 in IF. Some of you are comparing the 717 with the MD but they have several differences. I don‚Äôt like how short the 717 is compared to the Maddog.

---

JT_Playz | 2018-08-03 09:32:59 UTC | #81

Well originally the 717 [was supposed to be called the MD-95,] was designed by McDonnell Douglas to replace the DC-9‚Äôs. Boeing bought them before they could make it happen and that‚Äôs why it is called the 717. :)

---

Pinecone | 2018-08-03 10:57:57 UTC | #82

This would be my choice of the next aircraft to come to IF.

---

Dylan_M | 2018-08-03 12:45:27 UTC | #83

I would like it more if it was not so old and loud

---

Jeremy_H | 2018-08-03 12:52:29 UTC | #84

I love how loud it is. So much power in those engines. They shake our FBO windows when it takes off.

---

JT_Playz | 2018-08-03 14:43:54 UTC | #85

The sound of JT8D engines bring back the nostalgia for me.

---

HEYEY | 2018-08-03 15:01:36 UTC | #86

I would absolutely love this if it has all the demo liveries on it (assuming its gonna be added).

---

Pinecone | 2018-08-25 18:51:42 UTC | #87

I like how loud these üÖ±Ô∏èois are when they takeoff.

---

Sasquatch | 2018-08-25 20:46:53 UTC | #88

You got my vote on this! i love these planes

---

JT_Playz | 2018-09-11 15:30:33 UTC | #90

I like MAD DOGS more cuz they are older and I love JT8D engines!

I agree with you Pinecone.

---

Tombomb777 | 2018-09-13 03:26:51 UTC | #92

I fell in love with the MD-88 when I flew on one to ATL. For how old these planes are it was surprisingly clean and very comfortable. This is a **must have** for IF.

---

AlaskaAir | 2018-09-13 22:52:36 UTC | #93

I absolutely love this plane! I would like to see this with Allegiant, American and Delta liveries.

---

JT_Playz | 2018-09-13 22:59:20 UTC | #94

Don‚Äôt forget IF‚Äôs livery!

---

The cabin would look great and so would love to fly this in Atlanta!

---

HiFlyer | 2018-09-13 23:18:46 UTC | #95

This is a missing factor for airlines like DLVA. Delta IRL has sooo many Md-88/90s that I think it should be a plane in IF. The 717 just is not the same (not to mention OLD).

---

JT_Playz | 2018-09-13 23:22:30 UTC | #96

Yeah. Flew on the DC-9‚Äôs, MD80‚Äôs, and 717‚Äôs (MD-90‚Äôs) and I love them! (The 717 isn‚Äôt the same as the MD80‚Äôs and the MD-80‚Äôs aren‚Äôt the same as the DC-9‚Äôs.)

---

Charlie_Boothe | 2018-09-14 00:43:38 UTC | #97

Same here. These babies really do roar. That's one of the reasons I like flying in them. Even though they don't have IFE, the coolness of the plane really does make up for it.

---

NBSYT | 2018-09-14 00:50:03 UTC | #98

If the AirTran livery doesnt get put it here SMH üôÉ

---

Charlie_Boothe | 2018-09-14 00:50:33 UTC | #99

why? AirTran isn't the only airline to fly the MDs

---

JT_Playz | 2018-09-14 01:40:32 UTC | #100

AirTran flew 717‚Äôs and not MD‚Äôs. (Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong)

---

Luke_Sta | 2018-09-21 23:44:19 UTC | #101

You got my vote! Can't wait for this!

---

NordicFlyer | 2018-09-22 14:53:50 UTC | #102

I want this so bad! There are still some european charter-companies  who uses the md MD80
