Since Apple has announced Siri Shortcuts we can easily make look a like apps to simplify a lot of things. We can do this for Infinite Flight as well. For example, you want to fly but you don't have a lot of time to plan a flight, just run one of these shortcuts. Here are some shortcuts:

Make sure you have downloaded the [Siri Shortcuts app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334?mt=8)

Very Nicely Done. Thanks for your efforts.

How do you find your shortcuts that you made?

---

Mika | 2018-12-16 21:19:48 UTC | #4

Just a little fantasy :)

I noticed the rates of descent were a bit fast on the TOD calculation. Here‚Äôs my own version of it with a 2¬∞ descent (you were using 3¬∞ I believe). It also prompts the altitude of the airport and also calculates so that you are 25nm away from your destination and 10000ft above the airport altitude. Just some food for thought ;)

There‚Äôs a little bug in it... I‚Äôm going to fix it

---

DiamondGaming4 | 2018-12-16 22:50:04 UTC | #7

What is it? ü§î

---

Mika | 2018-12-16 22:53:28 UTC | #8

You didn‚Äôt had an option with ‚ÄòEnter Cruise Altitude Manually‚Äô but when I press 40000 it says ‚ÄòEnter Cruise Altitude‚Äô. And ‚ÄòMach Sprad‚Äô... so I fixed it :D

FBWFTW | 2018-12-16 22:58:39 UTC | #9

@Mika is there a way to get the route off another website?  Say Flightaware or even simbrief etc?

---

Mika | 2018-12-16 23:00:12 UTC | #10

Yes! I can do that later.. it‚Äôs 12AM here

---

FBWFTW | 2018-12-16 23:07:24 UTC | #11

No rush lol!  This is good stuff!  Particularly cause I fly on my iPad and use my phone as my ‚ÄúEFB‚Äù so to speak

Hey man I like the update you added to my TOD + VS widget. I‚Äôm glad to see people are able to use this widget. If you would like to collaborate to create other widgets for infinite flight let me know. Also I was using 3¬∞ for the descent rate. Isn‚Äôt that usually the standard descent rate? @Mika the reason why 40,000 wasn‚Äôt on the menu is because it cannot fit on the widget page.

DiamondGaming4 | 2018-12-17 04:08:47 UTC | #13

I usually use 2¬∞ for planes that are hard to slow down ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Christopher_Cupid-Pa | 2018-12-17 04:54:08 UTC | #14

Would anyone like to work on a project for calculating VSpeeds.

---

DiamondGaming4 | 2018-12-17 05:53:58 UTC | #16

Well, I primarily made it for my own uses, so that I can quickly make those calculations and Ron‚Äôs them in my head. I‚Äôll work on it tomorrow maybe.

---

Mika | 2018-12-17 06:50:00 UTC | #17

I can‚Äôt make one with SimBrief, as it‚Äôs a php site

---

Christopher_Cupid-Pa | 2018-12-19 21:24:11 UTC | #18

You know what would be a good widget? A widget that shows you the gate you're supposed to be parked at and the arrival gate if you're simulating a real flight.

FlightAware has that! That‚Äôs why I added it :D

---

Christopher_Cupid-Pa | 2018-12-24 16:24:41 UTC | #20

Is it like flightradar24?

---

Mika | 2018-12-24 18:54:16 UTC | #21

FlightAware has all info about the flight like route, average speed etc. and FlightRadar24 shows the 'small' info.

---

Christopher_Cupid-Pa | 2018-12-24 19:28:02 UTC | #22

Well this is awesome man. I love being able to get routes and info like this.
