Welcome to the Boeing 757-200 cockpit tutorial! Sorry for the delay on this one but now it’s finally here. This update introduces a full rework of the B752 aircraft model. Specifically, this tutorial will be all about the new cockpit which is very similar to our last updated aircraft, the [Boeing 777 family](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/the-new-b772-cockpit-explained/437707?u=brandon_k). You should be able to recognize the instruments quite well if you’re comfortable with the Boeing 777 family cockpit. Now let’s begin!

# Frequently Asked Questions

[details="How do I select a SID/STAR procedure?"]

Check out the tutorial below on how to manage certain procedures with your flight plan.

[Instrument Procedures Tutorial](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/instrument-procedures/440719)

[/details]

[details="What are the flap, takeoff, and landing speeds for the Boeing 757-200?"]

This data can be found in another tutorial. Check it out below!

[757 Unofficial Takeoff & Landing Profiles](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/757-unofficial-takeoff-landing-profiles/510903)

[/details]

[details="Where can I find the proper procedures/checklists for operating the Boeing 757-200?"]

The main checklist points can be found right in the cockpit! Check out your yoke and you will find checklists for various stages in your flights.

[details="How does the VNAV system work?"]

This takes some more explaining so there is a separate tutorial for this which can be seen below.

[The VNAV Tutorial](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/the-vnav-tutorial-wip/422694)

[/details]

[details="What is TCAS and where can I find it in the cockpit?"]

TCAS stands for traffic collision avoidance system and it’s main function in Infinite Flight is to show you surrounding aircraft on your Navigation Display. The aircraft on the display are marked with a white diamond with a couple of symbols and numbers next to it. There is an arrow which shows the aircraft vertical direction, up or down. It also includes a +/- which depicts altitude difference in hundreds of feet relative from your present altitude.

For Example:

- \+21 = 2,100ft above you
- \-21 = 2,100ft below you

[/details]

[details="How do I properly use the APU system?"]

Check out the tips below on when to start and use the APU system within your online flight.

- The Main Battery must be turned ON to start the APU.
- To start the APU, switch to APU START. Again, it will only start if your battery is on.
- In real life, the APU is started immediately after the Main Battery is turned ON.
- Shut down the APU as soon as the engines start.
- If you want to taxi with only one engine on a multiple engine aircraft after landing, start the APU first before shutting down any engines to maintain realism.

[/details]

[details="Is there a video tutorial that shows me how I can fly the B752 successfully? "]

Yes! Check out the official tutorial from Infinite Flight below:
