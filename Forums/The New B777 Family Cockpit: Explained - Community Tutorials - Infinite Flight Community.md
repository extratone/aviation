Welcome to the Boeing 777-200ER cockpit tutorial! This update introduces the first Boeing aircraft with a live instrument panel in Infinite Flight. In addition to the Boeing 777-200ER cockpit, the [Boeing 737 Family cockpit](http://www.community.infiniteflight.com) was also revamped. If you‚Äôre comfortable and familiar with the [A350-900 cockpit](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/the-a359-cockpit-explained/384757), then this shouldn‚Äôt be a challenge for you even though there are some differences. Take a read below to get caught up on the new features in the cockpit. Let‚Äôs begin!

# Frequently Asked Questions

[details="How do I select a SID/STAR procedure?"]

Check out the tutorial below on how to manage certain procedures with your flight plan.

[Instrument Procedures Tutorial](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/instrument-procedures/440719)

[/details]

[details="What are the flap speeds for the Boeing 777-200ER?"]

This data is actually always with you in the cockpit! Check out where you can find the speeds in the diagram below.

[/details]

[details="What does the APU do and when do I use it?"]

This update brings a brand new feature to Infinite Flight which is an Auxiliary Power Unit, or commonly known as APU. The APU functions mainly to maintain power to the aircraft when the engines aren‚Äôt ignited. Check out the tips below on when to start and use it within your online flight.

- The Main Battery must be turned ON to start the APU.
- To start the APU, switch to APU START. Again, it will only start if your battery is on.
- In real life, the APU is started immediately after the Main Battery is turned ON.
- Shut down the APU as soon as the engines start.
- If you want to taxi with only one engine on a multiple engine aircraft after landing, start the APU first before shutting down any engines to maintain realism.

[/details]

[details="How does the VNAV system work?"]

Also new to this update, we now have Vertical Navigation, commonly referred to as VNAV, in Infinite Flight. This takes some more explaining so there is a separate tutorial for this which can be seen below.

[The VNAV Tutorial](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/the-vnav-tutorial-wip/422694)

[/details]

[details="What is TCAS and where can I find it in the cockpit?"]

TCAS stands for traffic collision avoidance system and it‚Äôs main function in Infinite Flight is to show you surrounding aircraft on your Navigation Display. The aircraft on the display are marked with a white diamond with a couple of symbols and numbers next to it. There is an arrow which shows the aircraft vertical direction, up or down. It also includes a +/- which depicts altitude difference in hundreds of feet relative from your present altitude.

For Example:

- \+21 = 2,100ft above you
- \-21 = 2,100ft below you

Captain_Oblivious | 2020-06-14 23:24:40 UTC | #11

how can you tell if the APU is fully on? all i can notice are the loud sounds when APU startup is complete...

---

Ecoops123 | 2020-06-14 23:27:37 UTC | #12

In 'Systems > Electrical' the APU will go from 'APU START' to 'APU ON'

The top 3 numbers indicate the amount of fuel in the left, center and right fuel tanks.

The bottom number indicates total fuel on board (in thousands). The x 1000 means you multiply the bottom number by 1000 to get the actual number.

61.2 x 1000 = 61200 kgs of fuel
