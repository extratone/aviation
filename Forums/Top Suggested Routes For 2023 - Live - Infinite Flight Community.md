Welcome To the Suggested Routes For 2023!

Below is a list of Suggested Routes from myself and the community that are great to explore and fly if you are looking for something new, a scenic flight, a challenging landing, or anything in-between.

The routes below are broken up into 4 categories, these categories consist of:

| **Short Haul**   | **Any Route 1h 30m Or Below Of Flight Time** |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Medium Haul      | 1h 31m - 6h Of Flight Time                   |
| Long Haul        | 6h 1m - 12h Of Flight Time                   |
| Ultra Long Haul  | 12h 1m - 18h Of Flight Time                  |
| General Aviation | XXXX                                         |
