> I’d love to have group training sessions to practice flying and controlling together.

> I actually spend way more time running the pattern than I do flying routes. It’s something I can do for thirty minutes and then put down without losing access to my phone for several hours, and it’s a lot of fun to find likeminded randos on the Training server to practice with.

> There could even be “ground school” lessons taking place in the background explaining concepts related to what we’re practicing. For example, we can play a YouTube video about power curves while we practice slow flight.

> Thoughts?

I can't tell you how great it is to hear that others also do more pattern work/T&Gs than routes hehe. I've pretty much committed to the DC-10/MD-11 and handflying it as much as possible which really does seem to be requiring regular, regimented practice lol.

Regardless of where this might go in terms of established sessions within the VA, a *passive* means of informing each other/checking in that we've got a moment and are logging in to do so (perhaps just a single, centralized Discord/Disourse thread???) definitely sounds worthwhile to me!
