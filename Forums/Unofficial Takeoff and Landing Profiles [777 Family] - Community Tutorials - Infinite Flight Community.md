Welcome to the Unofficial Takeoff and Landing Profiles guide for the 777 family! This brief guide should get you into the air as well as on your way to a successful landing in just a few minutes. The tables below should be pretty self explanatory for the most part. Please read through the notes section at the end of this tutorial for further clarification on some of the items found within the table.

> #### Bonus:  There is a Quick Reference Guide at the end of this tutorial. You're more than welcome to download and save the PDF for imminent and future use.

## Purpose:

The purpose of this guide is to provide you with ball park speeds, flap settings, and power settings to get you in the air and onto the runway in one piece. These values are not 100% accurate as each flight is unique to what performance will be required.

> ****Note:** *Depending on the length of runway, weight, terrain and other considerations, a higher flap setting may be desired*

> *****Note:** *Takeoff over 75% may result in takeoff over Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW). This may also result in runway overruns. This could lead to overweight landings depending on your configuration. Consider all factors and risks.*

> **‚Ä° Note:** *APPR is disabled for landings greater than the loads below for where the Maximum Landing Weight (MLW) lies:*

- > 34% (777LR)
- > 45% (777-300ER)
- > 47% (772ER)
- > 58% (777F)

## Flaps

For reference the flap and various limitations for each setting are listed below. These can also be found in the cockpit of the 777 near the gear lever.

| Flaps | Speed Limitation |

|---|---|

| 1 | 255 kts |

| 5 | 235 kts |

| 15 | 215kts |

| 20 | 195 kts |

| 25 | 185 kts |

| 30 | 170 kts |

# General Notes

- > *For 25-50% loads, Flaps 5 was used for data*
- > *For 75-100% load, Flaps 15 was used for data*
- > **"Airborne By"** indicates a speed that you should be off the ground no later than. By the time you reach this speed, you should be in the climb and gear in the retraction process.
- > **Takeoff Power -** The first percentage is your throttle amount. The second value is the N1 read out as indicated in green above your throttle.
- > **100% throttle should never be used.** Aircraft in the real world very rarely exceed 100% as this is mainly used for emergencies only.
- > 20% trim was used to conduct these tests

*Additionally, please also reference* [*The New B772 Cockpit: Explained*](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/the-new-b772-cockpit-explained/437707)* topic for any other inquiries you may have in regards to the symbols or markings you may find in the cockpit. The cockpit for all 777's in Infinite Flight are the same in terms of design.*

> **Note:** *Fuel flow, thrust and other aircraft performance factors may apply.*

# Boeing 777 Quick Reference Guide

If you would like a quick reference guide, you're more than welcome to utilize this one that I've condensed into a 1 page sheet. It has just about everything you'll want to know in terms of *"What do I use for takeoff/cruise/landing?"* and *"When do I add/remove flaps or power?"*. Below is a screenshot of what this document looks like as well as a PDF download link for that crisp picture and saving for future use.

## Questions?

Feel free to add any questions or other helpful tips/pointers that you may find beneficial to others and myself or our helpful community members will gladly address those.

Please also check out the [https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/unofficial-a350-t-o-ldg-profiles/385370](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/unofficial-a350-t-o-ldg-profiles/385370) if you would like to see a similar table for the A350. I'll plan on making this "Unofficial" series a regular thing as aircraft are reworked or new from the factory.

Awesome tutorial as usual, Matt. üòä

This is amazing! Thanks Matt!

What trim do you recommend for TO & LDG?

Ps. Jk just saw your trim message

DeerCrusher | 2020-10-08 17:33:02 UTC | #5

[quote="DeerCrusher, post:1, topic:482895"]

20% trim was used to conduct these tests

[/quote]

I've found that 20% will work great for takeoffs. The heavier you are, the more trim you may need. In cruise and when heavy, I've found myself at in the 30-40% range.

Need to demote you from trainer. üòú

Ah no! I‚Äôll do anything

Shafran | 2020-10-08 17:40:09 UTC | #7

Thank you! Very much!

---

Skyler.Cooper | 2020-10-08 17:40:59 UTC | #8

I have found  that 40% works great from start to finish whether light or heavy

---

DeerCrusher | 2020-10-08 17:42:41 UTC | #9

Thanks for the input Scott! Yeah, I think it depends on how one calibrates their device and what trim feels comfortable. Trim is a flexible function that folks will have to play with.

---

Skyler.Cooper | 2020-10-08 17:48:00 UTC | #10

No problem and certainly is something that is specific to the user !!

Love the guide and is similar to what i have found during testing....

Thanks for your wisdom and community input Matt <3

xsrvmy | 2020-10-08 17:48:25 UTC | #11

@DeerCrusher Is N1 here the value required to maintain 15 degree pitch at V2+15? Just checking.

---

DeerCrusher | 2020-10-08 18:05:03 UTC | #12

Good question. 15 may be too much. You‚Äôre better off at putting pitch closer to 12 or 13 degrees. (Between the second and third pitch line)

---

xsrvmy | 2020-10-08 18:14:57 UTC | #13

Ah I didn't check online first, it's 14 degrees pitch for the 777

---

Jlewis | 2020-10-20 21:39:20 UTC | #14

Since the update, I‚Äôve found landing the 77W and 772 really difficult. It seems very sensitive when hand-flying, and I struggle to get it to maintain a steady rate of descent. I find myself too slow because it‚Äôs hard to lose height.

What trims would be good for landing with a 20-30% load?

---

DeerCrusher | 2020-10-21 16:39:21 UTC | #15

Trim will vary based on aircraft load, flap setting and the position of your device when you calibrated. I personally have found that it likes 20% for takeoff and landing. Some folks prefer a little more and some a little less.

The trick is finding "How much trim is needed to be neutral?" In otherwords, find the spot that requires the same amount of force to push the nose over just as you would pull back.

Absolutely beautiful!  Job well done @DeerCrusher!

Enigma | 2020-11-07 02:12:01 UTC | #17

This is awesome.  Thank you very much for taking the time to post!

anon57312879 | 2020-12-08 17:26:12 UTC | #18

The Final approach speed is the Vref?

---

Boodz_G | 2020-12-08 20:00:54 UTC | #19

Yes, it is.

---

anon57312879 | 2020-12-08 20:04:32 UTC | #20

Okay, so the final App. Speed should be Vref+5

---

JuliusFlight | 2020-12-08 20:04:54 UTC | #21

Awesome! Thanks so much for that!

---

Boodz_G | 2020-12-08 20:06:21 UTC | #22

Yes, exactly. The added speed on Vref varies based on the wind as well.

---

anon57312879 | 2020-12-08 20:07:09 UTC | #23

Okay, It seemed strange to me the Final App. Speed only was 130 kts

---

USA_ATC | 2020-12-08 20:11:35 UTC | #24

I was about to like this then saw it was on 69.

Awesome thread Deer!

Bookmarked for future flights with the 777.

165kts-170kts

[/quote]

Thats is a really fast approach lol

---

Luke_B | 2021-02-04 15:57:16 UTC | #28

Well, you shouldnt really even be approaching at that weight. Quite a bit over MLW

---

Jw2004 | 2021-02-19 17:15:00 UTC | #29

Hi y'all, I seem to be having some issues flying the B777's, none of the final approach speeds seem to correspond with the speeds I have when flying. I'll give an example: on final, 13kts head wind, 45% load (below MLW), full flaps and 30% trim. According to the QRG I am doing everything right. Yet my approach speed (airspeed) is 135kts, and my B777 seems to dislike that as I have to stay around 0.5¬∞ positive pitch. I touchdown at a speed of around 125KTS. it's quite annoying, as it doesnt seem to be realistic.

To conclude, does anyone happen to have a solution for this?

Thanks in advance!

John_Smith4 | 2021-02-22 12:07:19 UTC | #30

great. and thanks for sharing this resourceful post.

---

Tep_NEMO | 2021-02-22 14:30:10 UTC | #31

The best is to read the fcom (easy to find online) and get the useful numbers. Takes some time, but worth it in my view if one flies an aircraft regularly.

My two cents, of course

Happy flying!

what's a good 777F mach speed before violation territory warning and what a good ALT for 777 or does ALT not matter

---

Kamryn | 2022-01-28 05:35:15 UTC | #34

The average cruise speed for all 777 variants is Mach .84. Altitude always depends on your weight, keep in mind, for most long hauls, you should usually use the step-climbing method.

In addition to what @Kamryn said, you should check out @AndrewWu‚Äôs guide on the 777 family.
