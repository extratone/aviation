> # REWORKED 757 CRUISE PROFILE

20.3 is here! The reworked 757 is beautiful and a dream to fly. Here are some fuel profiles to help you get the best fuel economy.

> **How to Read This Guide**

An **orange** cell signifies a cruise altitude a little too high for that aircraft at that weight that carries smaller fuel penalties.

A **green** cell signifies a cruise altitude appropriate for that aircraft at that weight going East, maximizing fuel economy.

A **blue** cell signifies a cruise altitude appropriate for that aircraft at that weight going West, maximizing fuel economy.

A **grey** cell signifies a cruise altitude that is too low for that aircraft at that weight that may or may not carry a small or large fuel penalty.

**Fuel Capacity** is simply the maximum fuel that can be loaded onto that aircraft.

**Game-Estimated Maximum Flight Time** is the flight time that Infinite Flight tells you when you fully fuel your aircraft.

**Theoretical Maximum Flight Time** is the flight time calculated from these numbers that is theoretically possibly, waiving all IFR altitude rules and reserve fuel rules.

**Practical Maximum Flight Time** is the flight time calculated from these numbers that takes into account a 90% passenger and 75% cargo load (75% cargo load only for the Freighter), IFR altitude rules, and reserve fuel rules.

**Flight Profiles** are the ideal sequences of cruise altitudes for an aircraft at different loads.

> # Disclaimers

**Disclaimer I** : Numbers are from solo testing and have not been tested live yet.

**Disclaimer II** : The 757 has speed dip, meaning it sits at M 0.79 when set to 0.80. Measurements were taken with the AP at 0.80.

**Disclaimer III** : To keep it simple, I only took measurements every 10% load. If there were huge drops in fuel burn over those 10% I tried to take them into account when determining the climb profile.

**Disclaimer IV** : I am assuming linear rate of change of fuel burn between 10% increments. This is likely not the case, but it should be close enough.

**Disclaimer V** : Numbers in charts are in pounds. Works all the same for kilograms just different numbers.

> # 757-200

*Figure 1 - 757-200 Fuel Burn Chart*

![]()

**Fuel Capacity** : 76,968 lbs or 34,912 kg

**Game-Estimated Maximum Flight Time** : 10hr 17m

**Theoretical Maximum Flight Time** : 11hr 41m

**Practical Maximum Flight Time** : 9hr 53m (Eastbound) | 9hr 49m (Westbound)

**Flight Profile (East)**: FL310 (100%-41%), FL390 (40%-21%), FL410 (20%-0%)

**Flight Profile (West)**: FL300 (100%-71%), FL320 (70%-41%), FL400 (40%-0%)

> # Key Takeaways

**The 757 burns fuel predictably and reasonably**. No need to pack a ton extra.

**The 757 is not the most efficient at standard altitudes**. You don't need to avoid FL330-FL380, however, as the numbers aren't that different.

**The 757 is forgiving**. Even if you pick the wrong altitudes, it won't bite you.

> # Enjoy 20.3!

Nice topic Andrew!

Bookmarked, thanks a lot!

JetSuperior5192 | 2020-12-15 20:42:57 UTC | #4

Nice one :)

Oskapew | 2020-12-15 21:35:08 UTC | #5

Bookmarked! Love it!!

Curious about the reason for the big jump between 40% and 50%

---

AndrewWu | 2020-12-15 21:51:57 UTC | #6

It's due to the design of my testing, which is based on empirical data. All the mid-weight options (30-70 ish) net very similar fuel burn amounts, and so there just so happens to be a breaking point around 40-50 where higher altitudes are very very slightly favored.

Oskapew | 2020-12-15 21:52:42 UTC | #7

Oh, interesting!

---

AndrewWu | 2020-12-15 21:54:24 UTC | #8

Yup, and if you don't want to make that big jump while flying, I get that, and that's why I left the rest of the numbers up there so anyone can read, interpret, and make their own decisions on how they want to fly.

Very nice guide , I‚Äôm loving theses new guides being made for the 757.

---

United_Inc | 2020-12-15 22:01:54 UTC | #10

Wow FL310 then FL390 and nothing green in between üòÇ

---

AndrewWu | 2020-12-15 22:05:17 UTC | #11

Quite odd yes but once again just based on numbers, you could step through 330, 350, 370 and all will be fine.

HiFlyer | 2020-12-15 22:07:39 UTC | #12

Geez Andrew, future 757 pilot or something??

---

United_Inc | 2020-12-15 22:07:41 UTC | #13

No I understand I just thought it was funny from the 777 one that is out

---

AndrewWu | 2020-12-15 22:10:05 UTC | #14

Isaac on the IFC? What is life.

---

Altaria55 | 2020-12-15 22:15:44 UTC | #15

Andrew Wu with the math üò≥üò≥üò≥

---

AndrewWu | 2020-12-15 22:20:50 UTC | #16

Yeah, I can read a number off a screen and do basic functions, big math moment.

---

xsrvmy | 2020-12-15 22:57:21 UTC | #17

On the 777 there is a short window where 340/350 are most efficient. I have done the testing for it myself actually.

---

xsrvmy | 2020-12-15 23:03:13 UTC | #18

I'm doing testing myself as well. BTW something else I found: .85 more efficient than .80 lol, might use that if I use a 757 as a substitute aircraft for a long haul.

---

AndrewWu | 2020-12-15 23:08:16 UTC | #19

Oh that's cool, I was just using 0.8 bc it's the standard speed

---

xsrvmy | 2020-12-15 23:23:55 UTC | #20

Yeah I sometimes check other speeds a bit as well. The old 757 was the opposite lol, when it's light most efficient speed is like .72

pilot_aj01 | 2020-12-16 01:28:55 UTC | #21

Nice... love this üëèüèΩ
