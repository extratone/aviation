the local time will be 11:30 am, I chose this time to facilitate people from the inner world, some will do the flight at night and wake up in the morning for the landing and for those who are in america it will be daytime, so several destinations with different time

It's going to be a weekend.

MehdiMa0507 | 2019-02-11 20:52:43 UTC | #19

Alright! My aircraft will be a MD11-F. Destination EDDK instead of LFPG is that okay? Also would it be possible to make this flight on a saturday or friday because i'm living in germany and if I would fly out to Europe i would have to land at around 1 or 2am and I have to wake up at 6am. Just a suggestion ;D

Click on this. Then insert date and it will convert the time.

---

joslleymiguel_holand | 2019-02-18 02:53:43 UTC | #40

I know because I usually use this, but you have found something wrong, if you could clarify me, I would appreciate it because until now I can not understand it, I use this time as a reference, but the event is 1730Z

---

HadenJohnson | 2019-02-18 13:04:48 UTC | #41

I was just wondering if you used the insert date feature in settings because the time was the same but had a different marking at the beginning and a new marking at the end to what it usually has which is a black globe then the time.

---

HadenJohnson | 2019-02-18 13:06:08 UTC | #42

And yall will prob see me in a SWA plane. I plan flights up to a month away and this time us when I plan to depart. Heading to KLAX via KDAL in the 738

---

Niccckk | 2019-02-18 13:16:31 UTC | #45

True, but also just check the Zulu time in the title. You can use a Zulu time converter to convert it to your local timezone.

---

joslleymiguel_holand | 2019-02-18 13:18:24 UTC | #46

understood...

---

joslleymiguel_holand | 2019-02-18 13:21:12 UTC | #47

I think I'm going to take it off to not disturb anyone and just leave Zulu time, this time was for people who live on the east coast of america

---

@JeromeJ @Niccckk @Jeffrey_Owens @MehdiMa0507 @pelicanjars @Oli5 @Olic99 @Edivan_dcds, Hi everyone, how are you, so I've had a lot of complaints about when the event should start, so I decided to put it to the vote, and the top vote will be the time the event starts.

[poll type=regular results=on_vote public=true]

- event should start two hours early 1530Z
- continue like this 1730Z
- start two hours later 1930Z
- others

[/poll]

JeromeJ | 2019-02-28 16:46:17 UTC | #52

---

joslleymiguel_holand | 2019-02-28 17:03:14 UTC | #53

that's why I wanted to change time, my event was posted before them, but they have more people than I, I even wanted to change the date, but I just thought I'd change time

---

Niccckk | 2019-02-28 19:18:18 UTC | #54

That's why I wanted this event moved back.

---

joslleymiguel_holand | 2019-03-02 01:41:54 UTC | #55

so guys some people did not vote and others did not respond to my email, now it is very difficult to go under these conditions because the result is the same, I know there are not many people in the event but I hope that everyone can attend, I will change the time and It's going to be 1530Z, thank you.

---

Niccckk | 2019-03-02 14:26:39 UTC | #59

Will there be a chat for this event?

---

Edivan_dcds | 2019-03-02 15:14:19 UTC | #65

What is the runway going to be? 27 I guess?

---

Niccckk | 2019-03-02 15:16:49 UTC | #66

I am assuming so. I just spawned in.

---

joslleymiguel_holand | 2019-03-02 15:17:09 UTC | #67

the wind is not very strong then 27 may be also an option but if you do not want to have tail wind you can use 09 or 18s

---

joslleymiguel_holand | 2019-03-02 15:20:45 UTC | #68

Thank you for coming, we're leaving in 12 minutes.

joslleymiguel_holand | 2019-03-02 15:26:08 UTC | #70

Sorry for spawning in so late, I somehow messed up the time in my calendar, but I made it! :)

Unfortunately there wasn't enough time left to take a proper look at the planned HOTRD4 departure, but at least I was able to retrieve the original flightplan.

About to hit cruise on FL320, 5 stepclimbs and 14 hrs to go. ;)
