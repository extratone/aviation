# Regarding Reference Documentation for Editor Assets

Apologies if this doesn't end up being a generally constructive query but...

Other than what's contained in the rendered Scenery Editing Manual in the main public-facing documentation and the source repo it's based on, **are there any other established docs outside of the editor, itself**?

Just from what little I've observed as a newcomer, these past few days, just an index of all the available assets in the database seems like it would be all but necessary to keep one's head.
