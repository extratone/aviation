# Jefferson City Memorial Aiport

> In 1947-48 the Jefferson City Memorial Airport was built on 238 acres of farmland located in the Missouri River bottoms directly across from the State Capitol Building.  The original construction consisted of one paved runway that was 2,500 feet long, and two grass strips, each of which were also 2,500 feet long.  Improvements were made to the runways in 1956, 1963, 1972, and 1985, resulting in the configuration that we have today.  Currently, the main runway (12-30) is 6,000 feet long by 100 feet wide with a concrete surface.  It is equipped with high-intensity runway lighting and several instrument approach procedures.  The crosswind runway (9-27) is 3,400 feet long by 75 feet wide.  It has a concrete surface and medium-intensity runway lighting.  Both runways have parallel taxiways.  Additional facilities include the Airport Terminal Building, which was constructed in 1966, and the Air Traffic Control Tower which was commissioned in 1973.  Air traffic control services are available from 6:00 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., daily.  Control Tower staffing is provided by Midwest Air Traffic Services, Inc., through a contract with the FAA.  Radar approach control services are provided 24-hours per day by Mizzu Approach, which is located in Springfield, Missouri.
