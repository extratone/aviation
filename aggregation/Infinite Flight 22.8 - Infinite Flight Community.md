# Infinite Flight 22.8

In Infinite Flight 22.8, we are excited to bring a range of new features and improvements to enhance your flight simulation experience. As the Embraer E190 joins its E175 counterpart in the fleet, users can enjoy 27 new and exciting liveries while they explore the Infinite Flight skies!

# Important note for iOS

**iOS MAY NOT SHIP TODAY... KEEP READING.**

We're also shipping a lot of behind-the-scenes changes with 22.8 that include updates to our technology stack. These updates will help improve the overall performance and functionality of the app. Because of this, our developers will be releasing to Android first, followed by iOS when they are confident all known issues have been addressed.

Pushing to Android allows developers to control the rate at which the update rolls out to users, testing a little at a time. It also allows them to push fixes easily and more quickly than they would otherwise be able to do for iOS. This is a great benefit to iOS users as it allows us to work out potential issues without waiting for hotfix approval.

### Your 5-star rating helps us!

*If you want to support Infinite Flight by giving more visibility in the App Store and Google Play, don‚Äôt forget to give this update 5 Stars! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è You can re-submit your star rating with every update.*

otherwise great job y‚Äôall!

Chris_Wing | 2022-12-08 14:21:44 UTC | #22

Amazing to see the work done in this update from Airport editors creating amazing airports to the Infinite flight team bring us the E190!

I know a lot of work went into making this final update of the year make it to your app store before 2022 comes to an end. So if a livery didn't make it or there is a bug, please appreciate what has been released. I know I have been given opportunity to be in beta and I might get into trouble for saying this, but less than a month ago the original technical changes for 22.8 were scrapped due to some issues. This put a lot of pressure on the team to try and work on a final update for this year. So I'm glad to see all of the hard work has paid off! So well done Infinite Flight Team ‚ù§Ô∏è

Also a big shout out to the Beta team for finding issues and getting the E190 ready in such a short notice!

Enjoy the final update of the year everyone!

Yup, there's one in Minnesota and then the other is in Phoenix, Arizona being Phoenix Sky-Harbor international airport. I was also confused at first haha. Ngl, Americans are weird with the names because they can use the same name for different places which can make it confusing as to which is which.

---

JulietTango | 2022-12-08 14:26:09 UTC | #33

Looking forward to getting the update and trying out the E-190! I'm also super happy to see so many airports being added in this update.

Finally new airports in Saudi Arabia, the most important of which are OERK and OEDF. I can't wait to try it. Thank you to the Infinite Flight team, and thank you to Hadi, because he is the editor of Saudi airportsü§©.

It's a bit confusing sometimes, just like how every train station is somehow called Union Station :)

Just for reference, the airport list is automatically generated these days (since there are so many airport updates from our amazing scenery editing team!). Hopefully there are enough in there for you to spend many hours exploring

Still a work in progress, we have a number of liveries that need a bit more work (Jazeera is one of them iirc)

---

Ken_wei | 2022-12-08 14:28:38 UTC | #43

Fortunately, my home country of China doesn't have to worry about the names. In China, we have different names for different places so that's a good thing about us. ;)

Ok thanks so much!

Its still confirmed. All is said is a "future update" - doesn't mean the next update.

Wait, I thought they confirmed Jazeera Airways A320, what happened to that?!

Enri_DebeIV | 2022-12-08 14:33:31 UTC | #54

Well done for ITA airways. But I don‚Äôt understand the fact that, out of 120 new airports, only 1 is Italian, which, by the way, nobody uses. I know there are many countries, but Italy has so far only Rome and Venice as major airports, as Genoa and Florence are used very little. I am very disappointed with the way Italy is treated, compared to other European countries such as Germany or Spain. I would have expected at least 2/3 airports, of which Milan Malpensa, the largest hub in Northern Italy. Not to mention, of course, the disproportionate number of airports in England and the United States. I applied as editor just to help with that, but who knows where it ended up.

---

BennyBoy_Alpha | 2022-12-08 14:35:38 UTC | #55

@Enri_DebeIV The airport editors can choose what airports they do.... it's just unfortunate that Italy didn't get very many this time around.

Also most of the editors are fairly new-ish. When they first start out, they are only allowed to do small airports..

---

Yuen_Ming_Shen_Matth | 2022-12-08 14:38:37 UTC | #59

I think there is a misunderstanding, its ITA Tranportes Aereos and not ITA Airways. I see many users assuming its ITA Airways...Just a heads up.

---

Fourthnebula919 | 2022-12-08 14:38:30 UTC | #60

Adding on to @BennyBoy_Alpha, there are many external factors that contribute to which airports are chosen to be worked on. There might have been a lack of imagery or no editor willing to dedicate the time. These airports may have also been started and not revealed yet. For now, let's appreciate the wonderful airports, liveries and aircraft we got in this update.

---

Tucker_Ryan | 2022-12-08 14:40:00 UTC | #62

Are we looking at an iOS rollout in the next few hours or like next few days? Just to manage expectations

---

# *A wise man once said*

## If you're on Android then eventually you will get the update..

## If you're on Apple/IOS, then you should've made better decisions...

---

BennyBoy_Alpha | 2022-12-08 14:40:25 UTC | #65

Could be either...depends how stable the Android rollout is..

---

DrXavier | 2022-12-08 14:40:26 UTC | #66

The African Continent is once again disappointed... Not trying to start an argument whatsoever.. But wow.... A whole continent.. The major airports still missing in 3D.. I, however, cannot complain since I am no developer - we will keep enjoying the 3d-less airports in Africa...

---

Fourthnebula919 | 2022-12-08 14:40:41 UTC | #67

They are different airlines, I believe OP is correct.

---

Cameron | 2022-12-08 14:40:45 UTC | #68

We'll share when we're ready! We don't want to falsely promise something and then disappoint at this stage

---

BennyBoy_Alpha | 2022-12-08 14:41:05 UTC | #69

The problem with a lot of African airports is the lack of good-enough satellite scenery..

---

Enri_DebeIV | 2022-12-08 14:41:15 UTC | #70

Oh, I think you‚Äôre right. So here another reason to explain why, as Italian, I feel mocked by this update. It‚Äôs such a shame

---

Enri_DebeIV | 2022-12-08 14:42:49 UTC | #73

So you‚Äôre telling me that we‚Äôre images for all US airfields? Oh please, let‚Äôs not get caught by the backbones

---

parin365 | 2022-12-08 14:43:01 UTC | #74

Android gang, rise up!

---

BennyBoy_Alpha | 2022-12-08 14:44:32 UTC | #75

Just stop moaning. The editors work on what airports they want to. End of.

Yes that means more US airports get done as thats the largest demographic of people here on the forum by a considerable margin..and they work on their local airports as they are familiar with them.

---

Yuen_Ming_Shen_Matth | 2022-12-08 14:45:30 UTC | #76

Patience mate, the ITA airways livery is so beautiful but at the same time difficult to produce because its so unique, it will take time to produce a high quality livery for the aircrafts! I believe it will come onto the A350 and even the A320s soon, so dont be disappointed yet!

---

---

Madison | 2022-12-08 14:45:31 UTC | #79

i‚Äôm very thankful for all the editors who put so much effort into these 3d airports (and i hope that it isn‚Äôt stressful for them)

---

Madison | 2022-12-08 14:55:01 UTC | #80

with all due respect please stop talking

---

Enri_DebeIV | 2022-12-08 14:47:44 UTC | #81

Yes, now that‚Äôs the update so I have to accept that. But I you can‚Äôt image of how disappointed I am right now. Since when airports started to be in 3D, Italy was always a step behind the others. That means that I‚Äôll wait, another time. But I‚Äôm sure that I‚Äôll have to wait other 4/5 updates. Cheers üëãüèª

---

Janford_Recamadas | 2022-12-08 14:49:13 UTC | #82

Id love the new upcoming update wish to see the RPSP in the next update :) lovin the rework

---

Yuen_Ming_Shen_Matth | 2022-12-08 14:50:13 UTC | #83

Its confirmed for development, hopefully the next round we will have more Italian content, we cant be happy all the time, there are far more countries with little or only 1 3D airport like Thailand, vietnam, Malaysia etc. Italy has Rome, Venice, firenze and genova. Thats quite a number of nice airports

---

DrXavier | 2022-12-08 14:50:13 UTC | #84

I would like to believe that... But something else also says, that might not be a tad true... But hey, I am not a developer so I won't complain but it is just a shame in my opinion. I believe some airports are just favorable because they are.. I mean so many Africans pay the 11 bucks which is quiet a lot of money that can feed people for a week.. Yes.. Again, thanks for responding but also not trying to argue with people on here because I would like to believe that so many of us African pilots on here would like to really feel like we are heard.. (even if we are not developers)...

---

BennyBoy_Alpha | 2022-12-08 14:51:47 UTC | #85

The problem is 3D imagery...2D imagery is fine with a lot of African airports.

But to make an airport 3D requires accurate and decent-quality **3D** imagery..and a lot of African airports, especially remote ones in the middle of nowhere (of which there are a lot of those) fall short on that part.

---

Ken_wei | 2022-12-08 14:51:48 UTC | #86

It's a shame how ITA transportes aereos ceased operation back in May of this year
