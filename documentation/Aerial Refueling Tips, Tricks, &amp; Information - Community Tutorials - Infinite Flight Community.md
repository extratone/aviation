## **The Aircraft**

With the newly pushed update aerial refueling is now possible for the aircraft listed below:

- F14 (Tomcat)
- F16 (Falcon)
- F22 (Raptor)
- C130 (Hercules)
- C17 (Globemaster)
- VC25 (Air Force One)
- KC10 (Extender)
- A10 (Warthog)
- F/A-18E (Rhino)

---

## **Tips for the Aircraft being Refueled:**

- If you are hand flying the refueling process, try to keep **control movements to a minimum**. Autopilot will give you best precision when refueling
- **Coordinate with the tanker** the plan of action. Ensure you have the flight plan, altitude, and speed at which the tanker will be flying.
- **Fly 50ft below the tanker‚Äôs altitude.** In Infinite Flight we are unable to select a 50ft interval altitude. We are only able to select an altitude in 100ft intervals. (You can technically refuel at the same altitude as the tanker, but for realism sake...) To fly at an altitude other than that 100ft interval try following these steps:

**1.**  Start out at the same altitude as the tanker.

**2.** Once you get close (1nm or less) set your cruise altitude 100ft below the tanker.

**3.** When you do this the default VS is -250fpm. However, what you should do is change this to -100fpm once the descent begins.

**4.** As you're about 50ft below the tanker, swipe the VS to 0. You'll want to lead this by a few feet, and it‚Äôll hold you at whatever altitude you had displayed when you switched the VS to 0. Essentially you could cruise at 25,457ft and hold that altitude if the tanker is flying at 25,500ft

***Disclaimer:***

*Keep in mind that this will not hold you at that altitude forever. It should hold you at that altitude long enough for you to refuel your aircraft.*

May sound a bit confusing but it‚Äôs just a little something that I found that worked to hold a ‚Äúnon-100ft‚Äù altitude.

---

## **Tips for the Tanker:**

- Create a flight plan that will have a straightly distance of **at least 100nm**. Anything shorter of 100nm can be a bit of a struggle for the aircraft being refueled to make contact and to fuel up.
- **Coordinate with the aircraft being refueled** your plan of action. Ensure you have the flight plan loaded and of reasonable length legs, an appropriate altitude, and speed at which you will be flying. **Communication is key** to ensuring that both you and the aircraft being refueled are on the same page

---

## **Suggested Refueling Speeds/Altitude:**

Plane	                Altitude	    Speed (KIAS)
F22	                    28,000-30,000	M.82
F18E                    28,000-30,000	M.82
C/AC 130	            8,000           210 kts
F14	                    28,000-30,000	M.82
F16	                    28,000-30,000	M.82
VC25 (Air Force One)	25,000	        275 kts
KC10	                25,000       	290 kts

---

## **Helpful Information:**

As made known to the community in a response from Tyler, the aircraft being refueled *‚Äúmay only accept the amount of fuel equal to three (3) full tanks‚Äù*. [Sourced here](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/fighter-aircraft-etiquette/169833/8) üëàüèº

- **What does this mean?** If your aircraft can carry 10,000lbs (4500kgs) of fuel, you may only refuel 30,000lbs (13,600kgs) in that session before you are unable to aerial refuel. You should be able to refuel upon landing at the nearest airport of your choice.
- **(Optional)** Once you have topped off, pull along side your tanker and get some sweet pictures of your refueling experience. üòÉ

swyft | 2017-12-09 02:53:17 UTC | #6

Thanks for the helpful tips, Deer. It's a great feature. We need some professional refuellers up to help us in the advanced server. I sense a growth of a new expert VO!

DeerCrusher | 2017-12-09 02:53:43 UTC | #7

Yes but its classified under the DC10F. I can change it. üòä

S_Olejniczak | 2017-12-09 06:28:31 UTC | #8

You say that you can only refuel 3 full times per session.  By session, do you mean that flight, or does it reset if you land and refuel at an airport without ending the flight?

---

Will_Haxton | 2017-12-09 15:20:20 UTC | #9

So if I am reading this correctly, the Hornet (F/A-18) can‚Äôt be refueled with the tanker?

---

Yes, I belive so. Seeing that it‚Äôs very old and not up to date, it does not.

I was the tanker, however it seemed like the pilot of the fighter was hand flying, not using AP.

---

anon2063420 | 2017-12-09 15:51:16 UTC | #13

For minor adjustments to line up and maintain the line with the aircraft I suggest using yaw to line up. You will notice this will make it far more specific than using roll. When refueling the KC10 refueling the other aircraft should not be the one moving but should be the aircraft hooking up to the KC10.

Did they add A/P to the fighters? I didn't read it on the release thread.

---

AnikaitD | 2017-12-09 15:54:46 UTC | #15

They sure did :D hand flying a jet while refueling would be tough lol

---

ServerGhost | 2017-12-09 16:15:38 UTC | #16

Yes they did!

It's great!!

---

Major-Tom | 2017-12-09 17:17:35 UTC | #17

It has nothing to do with the age of the F18 in IF.

The F18 has a probe for refusing with a bucket, the KC10 in IF is currently only equipped with a boom system....

---

KindaAngrySliceOfPie | 2017-12-09 17:18:08 UTC | #18

Ah. Thank you for informing me.

---

Will_Haxton | 2017-12-09 17:40:06 UTC | #19

Well that makes since, but the F-14 uses the bucket system too. And I‚Äôm pretty sure it was on the list.

---

Major-Tom | 2017-12-09 17:46:51 UTC | #20

Gotcha!

You are right....

---

DylanIE | 2017-12-09 18:17:31 UTC | #21

I literally was inside the tube in a c-130 for about 30 seconds and nothing happened. Surely it can't be this hard?

---

Major-Tom | 2017-12-09 22:27:25 UTC | #22

Refuelling while the tanker has the boom up is possible

![]()

Unfortunately....

Beside this, excellent wor, FDS!

---

DeerCrusher | 2017-12-09 22:36:47 UTC | #23

Yes. This is a know thing. Refueling will occur regardless of boom position.

---

anon2063420 | 2017-12-09 22:40:04 UTC | #24

So someone not wanting to refuel can be trolled, with consequences now. That really does not seem right.

---

DeerCrusher | 2017-12-09 22:41:08 UTC | #25

No because fuel is not directly pulled from the tanker. In other words the refueling process has no affect on the tanker.

---

anon2063420 | 2017-12-09 22:42:40 UTC | #26

So it is a one way street. One just refuels but no fuel is lost? Why on earth would they go that route?

---

DeerCrusher | 2017-12-09 23:42:32 UTC | #27

I‚Äôm sure it could be implemented but I can‚Äôt speak for why it doesn‚Äôt pull from the tanker as you‚Äôd think. My leading hunch is telling me that a plethora of fighters could swarm a tanker and drain the beast in a few mins. Could be an easy way to troll someone if you ask me.

---

SVEN_MORLEY | 2017-12-10 00:06:55 UTC | #28

Man, I can't wait for events where you have to wait in line and such.

---

ServerGhost | 2017-12-10 00:13:48 UTC | #29

I wonder why there wasn't a feature added to communicate with other aircraft.

Through the ATC menu.

"Air force 452, Air Force 390 requesting contact"

"Air force 452, Air Force 390 requesting refuel"

"Air force 452, Good day"

---

anon2063420 | 2017-12-10 00:15:23 UTC | #30

Ok thought that even with the boom up they could drain fuel from you but knowing that isnt the case makes more sense. Just glad they prevented an avenue for trolls

---

Jake_Stopher | 2017-12-10 22:59:34 UTC | #32

Woah woah woah.....you can refuel the KC10, with the KC10?

ojt169 | 2017-12-11 05:39:48 UTC | #33

Why cant we refuel the C-17?

---

Callum_Brayshaw | 2017-12-11 05:52:26 UTC | #34

Autopilot is for the people who are to lazy to not hand fly which for me when I get close to the tanker I switch off Autopilot for some hand flying experience and it also allows you to understand more of how the jet is handling

---

ServerGhost | 2017-12-11 12:58:07 UTC | #35

Autopilot is a personal preference based on the pilots ability to hand fly.

I wouldn't necessarily call people lazy for using it, because in all reality real life pilots use autopilot too.

Plus there are different instances of autopilot, one to maintain speed, one to maintain altitude, one to maintain heading and vertical speed, it's helpful for beginner pilots to use speed and heading autopilot while refueling so they can remain consistant.

---

Recxx | 2017-12-11 14:42:37 UTC | #36

IMHO...while the new addition of autopilot to the fighter class in the latest global update to the sim is welcome as to long excursions ...it does not negate the fact that aviating is still a fine balance between controlling your angle of attack and your throttle speed.. which become your  primary objectives as you learn to respect and adjust to the forces which allow the remarkable operation of an airfoil in accordance with Bernoulli's Principle as applied to the properties of aviation ...that said...in regard to air to air tanker refueling ...l once had a fighter sim for the pc back in the late 80's l believe ...which faithfully duplicated the refueling scenario to the level where you had to actually not only match a predetermined distance from a  KC-135 tanker...but actually touch the connection hose to a specific spot on the fighter where it would automatically attach to begin the refueling operation ...and since your yaw and pitch had to be accurate to achieve this goal...it was truly a thrill to hand fly ...either with a joystick or  the keyboard ...the latter of which l preferred since l was too lazy at times to reattach the joystick as l had needed to connect the other ports on the pc for many other applications ...including X10 module management...but in essence l learned much more from hand flying in regard to    maintaining stability in fighter-tanker related operations !!!

Irl does the tanker have a separate Tank and for for refueling, or does it feed directly from the main tank?

Sebastian_Arias91 | 2017-12-12 02:06:27 UTC | #39

Does the Tanker have to be above MLW in order to transfer fuel?

Capt_Whiplash | 2017-12-12 22:15:05 UTC | #41

Hi, I thought this might be a good place to post some information I built of a static AR Track based on RL AR207 that anyone can use.  It's not perfect but I think it's a good balance for gameplay vs RL procedures.

AAR Area: AR207 (KVAD - KRDU)

AAR Anchor Waypoint: AMG - RDU

Flight Level: FL220-280

Speed:

For HOLDING ORBITS and ANCHOR POINT turns: 180~200 KIAS

AR SPEEDS:

Plane	                Altitude	    Speed (KIAS)

F22	                       20,000-28,000	310 kts

C/AC 130	       12,000-22,000 	210 kts

F14	                       20,000-28,000	300 kts

F16	                       20,000-28,000	300 kts

VC25 (Air Force One)	20,000-28,000	260 kts

KC10	                20,000-28,000

Base Airport: KVAD

Tanker Callsign: URCLS XX

NOTAM:   Here are some special notes for maximum benefits balancing RL vs Gameplay:

Refuel on track only. Please DO NOT attempt during en route to/from track, take off and final

Copy FPL

Track initial point/ entry at AMG

Meet tanker at BAXLY - ICMF

TANKER make turn for return leg at W77/RASKL

South Track IP is RASKL

Re-establish tanker refueling at SDZ

Return leg terminus left turn will be at RUGOC and re-establish North leg.

Receiver holding pattern, left turns  at AMG to wait for Tanker

If no receiver TANKER will orbit BAXLY/ICMF/CIGOX/RUGOC and wait

FPL:

AMG BAXLY ICMAF LOTTS DOVER CUMEN SSC08 52J W77 RDU W77 RASKL SDZ YELLS OXHED NANIE CIGOX RUGOC BAXLY

This track can also be set up for a southern run but needs hold points off the track.  With enough discipline of all involved you can have multiple tankers and receivers timed N/S, S/N and altitude stacked between altitudes listed above.

ATC at KAVD/KRDU/KPOB could be of great help if available.

This can be even more complicated due to no direct communication with Tanker and it only takes 1 not wanting to follow established procedures to mess it up.

Anyway, I hope others can put this

AndrewWu | 2017-12-13 01:05:22 UTC | #42

I don't think so. It doesn't actually take any fuel out of the tanker

---

Rabbit | 2017-12-13 14:10:28 UTC | #43

It‚Äôs all within the same tank. All fuel is used for refueling and flying the actual aircraft.

Divingbertybsac | 2018-01-04 14:35:50 UTC | #46

Hi,

When trying to catch the tanker a/c how do I find the speed at which it is travelling. What I normally do is check the tanker a/c‚Äôs speed by pressing on it aand it gives me a speed (which I believe to be ground speed) and set my ground speed to catch it up.  However, when I get close I reduce my speed to just a little more than the tankers ground speed and reduce more  as I get closer.  But, I still tend to overshoot.  What am I doing wrong?. For information, I usually fly the F14 and even with spoiler on I still overshoot.  Any help would be gratefully received.

---

Major-Tom | 2018-01-04 15:04:01 UTC | #47

Hi @Divingbertybsac,

congratulations! You found the major difficulty in joining another Aircraft!

The trick is to reduce speed early enough to something not more then 20knots above KIAS of the other aircraft without spoilers. This is an overspeed amount that you should manage to drop of with throttle cut and spoilers.

If you notice that you are to fast at a significant distance, you could flare to achieve a reduction in speed, but its difficult to keep correct attitude by this.

It although depends on the aircraft, for the F16 by example some quick turns are good for speed reduction as well.

The Speed of the other aircraft indicated in IF is Ground speed, that‚Äôs correct, but it might help to know the IAS of the other one beforehand. You could get it in the NOTAM in the refuellers tracking thread (link above).

There are some real world procedures you can find with google, but they are difficult to replicate in IF because the main coordination is done by plane to plane communication....

Try to finde out how much speed reduction the F14 has with Throttle cut and spoilers deployed at the same time, or how fare you go for a given speed delta. Those numbers are needed for each aircraft type.

So, keep practice!

Recxx | 2018-01-04 15:33:18 UTC | #48

Aerial refueling in this sim is a piece of cake..l once had a fighter sim for the pc back in the '80's where you had to actually position yourself exactly in line with refueling hose so it touched a connection spot on the fighter and locked on ...so all you have to do here is get within a sufficient proximity... much easier task !!!

Can C-17 be refueled in IF? I‚Äôm presuming that it is not possible until it get reworked like F-18.

---

Recxx | 2018-07-04 13:57:37 UTC | #54

Aside from the fact that the C-17 is NOT currently listed as capable of AAR...it appears that you have answered your own question  !!!

---

Deaf | 2018-07-04 20:36:14 UTC | #55

@Recxx  I already knew that C-17 in IF couldn‚Äôt be refueled. However, you guys in this thread forgot to mention C-17. Even @DeerCrusher failed to mention it while F-18 was mentioned even through it wasn‚Äôt in the list. I was just bring it up so other people would know that it cannot be refueled.

No need to add bunch of the exclamation point or uppercase a word. In fact, just a period is sufficient. Have a great Independence Day!

---

Captain-Cade | 2018-12-04 02:40:51 UTC | #57

Yep. Refueling here is incredibly easy, so I don‚Äôt use autopilot. You don‚Äôt need to.

---

Recxx | 2018-12-04 03:14:41 UTC | #58

Not if you have intermittent but severe wifi lag because the app will say refueling completed when it it not correct...so far have not found a way around it...but hopefully l will by next year !

PHDFLOPPER_GAMING_2 | 2018-12-15 14:52:05 UTC | #59

We should have boom operator to receiver communication.  The terminology, if it has not changed from when I retired in 2012 is:

The visual signal for A/R is the boom down and extended to ten feet.  Here are Emission Communication Option Three communications:

Viper 26, (F16), Raid 51 cleared astern.

The F16 or any other rcvr will position 50 feet behind the boom and a little low.  We call that the thirty-degree angle.  Once the receiver is stable the boom operator will say:

26 cleared to contact.

The boom operator will tell the pilot crew over interphone or interplane exactly where the rcvr is.  In other words:

BO: 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 5, then 51 contact.

Rcvr acft: 26 contact.

The BO will control the entire AR telling the pilot team where the rcvr is and verbal corrections to the rcvr pilot.

Verbal Corrections:  The A/R envelope for an f16 is 25 upper, 35 lower elevation. 10 Left and Right.

So:  Up 4, down 4, left 4, right 4.

I hope this helps and is informative.  Email me with questions.  I was a Boom for 10 years and a Comm guy for 14.

PHDFLOPPER_GAMING_2 | 2018-12-15 14:52:53 UTC | #60

I was a boom operator on the kc-135.  I understand this is a sim but all receivers hand fly their jets during A/R.  I am new to the community.  I can post the the KC-135 and all receiver A/R speeds if the community would like it?  I need a instructions on how to do it.  We should form an Air Refueling Wing at one of the US or overseas tanker bases.  The sim owners should build the KC135R, the A330 MRTT, and the US KC46 so we can have several tankers to choose from.

When  refueling with the KC-10; is the fuel considered "cargo" or it doesn't matter

---

Andre_S | 2019-04-04 11:08:40 UTC | #63

Welcome to the community!

No, fuel is not considered as cargo.

You don‚Äôt have to carry cargo to be able to refuel.

With a bit of practice you can get right up close and actually contact the boom, even during a turn. These are fairly old screenshots from a GAF exercise:

There was some lagging forward and back but my average position relative to the tanker was about right.

Contrary to the advice given by @Deercrusher, I recommend hand flying throughout the refuelling procedure, it's more precise.
