#### We have a wide variety of aircraft that are available for use by our members. This selection allows members to fly everything from the shortest of FedEx Feeder routes, up to the longest duration routes in our database. We strive to build a flight schedule that both represents realism and creates enjoyable flights for our pilots. Below you will find the Cessna, Boeing, and McDonnell Douglas aircraft that we operate.

All of the aircraft we operate on our routes unlock at our entry rank of Trainee. We believe that our members should have the ability to fly any of our liveried aircraft, on any of our routes from Day 1. This unique feature is something we hope our members find appealing to them as a member of FDXV.
