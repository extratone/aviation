## Set an ideal device configuration, prepare IFAssistant and IFOperations for flight.

![215254859-e010371e-b812-45f4-901b-83b4c334beca.png](Infinite%20Flight%20Launcher%20Shortcut.assets/215254859-e010371e-b812-45f4-901b-83b4c334beca.png)

This shortcut is intended to automate the process of preparing one's device configuration and assistant apps for flight in [*Infinite Flight*](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/infinite-flight-simulator/id471341991).

At installation, you will be asked to optionally specify the [Focus Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212608) you'd like to be activated before flight.

Here are the steps taken by default, in chronological order:

1. WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities are set `ON`
2. Screen brightness is set to `100%`
3. If specified, your chosen focus mode is activated
4. [IFAssistant](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1180642964) and [IFOperations](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1448204117) are launched in Split Screen
5. A [Set Playback Destination](https://matthewcassinelli.com/actions/set-playback-destination/) dialogue will prompt you to select an audio device for output (in case you have headphones/speakers connected.)
6. Orientation lock is set to `ON`
7. If the device is not currently connected to power, a notification will be shown and a "minimums" TCAS warning will sound
8. Infinite Flight is opened

I personally have it installed [on my home screen](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/add-a-shortcut-to-the-home-screen-apd735880972/ios) with an alternate (but still identifiable) [icon](https://davidblue.wtf/aviation/InfiniteFlightAltIcon.png), but there are several other methods of running it from elsewhere including:

- [An assigned Siri phrase](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/run-shortcuts-with-siri-apd07c25bb38/ios)
- [A home screen widget](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/run-shortcuts-from-the-home-screen-widget-apd029b36d05/ios)
- Literally anywhere you can place a hyperlink with `shortcuts://run-shortcut?name=Infinite%20Flight%20Launcher`
- [Your Apple Watch](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/run-shortcuts-from-apple-watch-apd5888b0858/ios)

I made a Siri Shorcut for @infiniteflight users to make the process of preparing one's device and assistant apps (IFAssistant and IFOperations :) just a wee bit quicker.
