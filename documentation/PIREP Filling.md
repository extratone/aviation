## PLEASE NOTE

#### PIREP Form Comments Section

::Pilots are required to use the comments section on the PIREP form to inform the flight log staff of the original flight time and which bonuses are used, if any.:: Failure to do so may result in a rejected PIREP.

Once your PIREP is submitted, it will be placed into a pending status. When the PIREP has either been approved or denied, you will receive a notification to the email you have on file with us with the status of your report and any notes. You can also view the status of your PIREP on the Crew Center under your `Logbook & History`.

If you have any questions about your PIREPs, file a ticket via the #┃support-channel and we will be happy to help.

The FedEx Express Virtual Chief Team reserves the right to make changes at any time.
