Howdy! I realize this is my first contribution, but it's actually one I've considered quite thoroughly. Unfortunately, beyond citing my own experience as a discerning flight sim user of more than 15 years, I'm not exactly sure what is considered an authority, here.

Instead of making my personal argument up front, I guess I'll reference PC Gamer's encyclopedia definition(??) of "flight simulator."

> Hardware and software that models the behavior of airplanes and spacecraft. Flying a plane can be simulated in a regular computer with flight simulator software; however, pilots and astronauts learn how to fly in full-scale systems that recreate the experience with extreme realism.

Obviously, I would be more delighted to continue defending this addition if necessary

Thank you for your time!
